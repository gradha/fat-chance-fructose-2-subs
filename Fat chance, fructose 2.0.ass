Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.56,0:03:44.66,Default,,0,0,0,,that he's here tonight, 'cause I didn't wanna give this lecture as well
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.40,0:03:50.43,Default,,0,0,0,,but in addition to his work, Rob recently took a sabbatical

Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.66,0:04:04.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and part of his aspiration I think is really to aid his legal training now

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.90,0:04:12.06,Default,,0,0,0,,to continue to advocate for good nutrition around the world so

Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.23,0:04:20.76,Default,,0,0,0,,we've entitled the talk the same title as his best selling book
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.76,0:04:25.56,Default,,0,0,0,,"Fat Chance" and added the subtitle "Fructose 2.0", Rob
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.93,0:04:41.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Thank you Bobby and thank all of you for coming, you know, to some extent this is sort of like dejavu all over again
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.70,0:04:47.90,Default,,0,0,0,,you know having done this 4 years ago and it really did change my life and hopefully changed a few peoples' lifes
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.90,0:04:51.03,Default,,0,0,0,,in the audience and certainly around the world
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.03,0:04:57.83,Default,,0,0,0,,I still get emails from that video today, ah, you know, people who've seen it for the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.23,0:05:05.46,Default,,0,0,0,,that video we are gonna refer back to it in some, to some extent tonight
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.50,0:05:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,'cause I am not gonna redo the biochemestry, there's no point in doing it twice
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.16,0:05:13.46,Default,,0,0,0,,what we're gonna talk tonight about is primarily the physiology
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.46,0:05:19.93,Default,,0,0,0,,so, in essence, the two videos will end up being complementary on youtube
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.90,0:05:24.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and hopefully people who watch it will end up watching both, so keep that in mind
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.66,0:05:34.36,Default,,0,0,0,,all right, well, a lot happened in four years, and the data just keeps rolling in, and unfortunately for us all the data is pretty awful
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.36,0:05:40.06,Default,,0,0,0,,so you'll see why as we go and I will try to delineate that as we go
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.06,0:05:44.93,Default,,0,0,0,,so first of all I have no disclosures, no food industry is putting me up to this
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.93,0:05:47.30,Default,,0,0,0,,you be sure of that
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.16,0:05:51.26,Default,,0,0,0,,so here's the past, this is 2001
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.26,0:05:54.86,Default,,0,0,0,,6 million kids are seriously overwheight, well
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.86,0:06:00.80,Default,,0,0,0,,with all of the media attention, with all of the NAH money, with all of the clinical programs
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.80,0:06:04.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and with Michelle Obama's vegetable gardens we are now up to 20 million
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.96,0:06:07.13,Default,,0,0,0,,here's the present
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.13,0:06:12.66,Default,,0,0,0,,currently there are 30 percent more obese people on the planet than undernourished people
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.66,0:06:18.96,Default,,0,0,0,,and this has happened only within 15 years because 15 years ago was exactly the opposite
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.96,0:06:23.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's occurring in countries that still have under nutrition
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.20,0:06:26.76,Default,,0,0,0,,so how do you explain that, other than to say
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.76,0:06:29.80,Default,,0,0,0,,that can't be behaviour, that's gotta be an exposure
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.80,0:06:33.50,Default,,0,0,0,,this looks like any standard pandemic
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.50,0:06:36.06,Default,,0,0,0,,influenza, typhoid, etc
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.06,0:06:43.53,Default,,0,0,0,,this looks like a microbial phenomenon rather than a behavioral phenomenon, we're gonna go there
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.66,0:06:48.80,Default,,0,0,0,,366 million diabetics walking the earth, that's 5 percent of the worlds' population
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.80,0:06:52.10,Default,,0,0,0,,and they are chewing through all the health-care resources
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.93,0:06:59.50,Default,,0,0,0,,this was just three months ago, diabetics cost the US 24 billion dollars
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.50,0:07:05.23,Default,,0,0,0,,now if we could recoup even a fraction of that we wouldn't even need health-care reform
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.23,0:07:09.56,Default,,0,0,0,,in fact it's been suggested that we wouldn't even need financial reform
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.56,0:07:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,ok, 41 percent rise in 5 years, this is going up so fast it makes your head spin
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.33,0:07:17.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and here's the future if we do nothing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.80,0:07:24.36,Default,,0,0,0,,experts predict 165 million Americans, 42 percent would be obese by the year 2030
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.36,0:07:29.73,Default,,0,0,0,,100 million Americans, that'll be 33 percent, will have diabetes by 2050
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.73,0:07:35.30,Default,,0,0,0,,but fear not, because it won't really matter because Medicare will be broke by 2026
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.30,0:07:39.80,Default,,0,0,0,,so, as the Soup Nazi once said: "No health-care for you"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.63,0:07:45.93,Default,,0,0,0,,well, the fact of the matter is, I'm gonna be 69 in 2026 and I want my fricking Medicare
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.93,0:07:49.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and… so should you all
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.26,0:07:54.93,Default,,0,0,0,,the point is, we have to do something different, and you know the old adage, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.93,0:07:59.90,Default,,0,0,0,,the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.90,0:08:04.70,Default,,0,0,0,,well I'm here to tell you for the last 30 years we've done the same thing over and over and over again
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.70,0:08:07.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and there has been no change in the result
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.90,0:08:13.66,Default,,0,0,0,,so we have to rethink this, we have to reframe the argument and that's what we are gonna try to do tonight
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.66,0:08:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and I'm'a doit right now
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.00,0:08:18.86,Default,,0,0,0,,so here's the way people view this issue
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.86,0:08:22.43,Default,,0,0,0,,this is a Venn diagram of all the adults in America
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.43,0:08:27.40,Default,,0,0,0,,30 percent obese over here, and 70 percent normal weight over here
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.40,0:08:32.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and everybody assumes that the problem is this group over here because
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.26,0:08:37.13,Default,,0,0,0,,80 percent of the obese population is sick in some fashion
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.13,0:08:42.46,Default,,0,0,0,,with type-2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.46,0:08:46.96,Default,,0,0,0,,none alcoholic fatty liver disease, polysistical ovarian disease, etc, etc
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.96,0:08:53.56,Default,,0,0,0,,so, if you do the math on this, that's 80 percent of 30 percent of 240 million, that's 57 million sick
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.56,0:08:57.03,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's those 57 million that are bankrupting the country
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.03,0:09:00.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and so it's the obese person's fault only
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.90,0:09:03.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and that's the way everyone views this
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.93,0:09:09.06,Default,,0,0,0,,this is wrong, this is a mistake, this is a disaster actually, because it is not correct
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.06,0:09:16.63,Default,,0,0,0,,here's the real story, in fact, 20 percent of the obese population is completely metabolically normal
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.63,0:09:21.06,Default,,0,0,0,,they have normal insulin dynamics, they don't get sick,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.06,0:09:25.23,Default,,0,0,0,,they will live a completely normal life, die at a completely normal age,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.23,0:09:28.96,Default,,0,0,0,,cost the taxpayer nothing, they're just fat
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.96,0:09:37.06,Default,,0,0,0,,conversely, up to 40 percent of the normal weight population have the exact same metabolic dysfunction
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.06,0:09:42.63,Default,,0,0,0,,that the obese do, they are just normal weight, and so they don't even know they are sick, until it's too late
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.63,0:09:50.66,Default,,0,0,0,,because, normal weight people get type-2 diabetes, they get hypertension, they get dyslipidemia, they get cardiovascular disease, they get cancer, they get dementia, etc, etc
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.66,0:10:01.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and so when you do the math on that, that's another 67 million, so that's actually outclassing the obese, and so the total is 124 million, that's more than half of all of America
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.40,0:10:05.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, you may remember HIV
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.43,0:10:12.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Remember HIV? When did HIV become a public health crisis?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.03,0:10:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,No, not in the 80s
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.00,0:10:18.63,Default,,0,0,0,,In the, in 1991
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.63,0:10:24.16,Default,,0,0,0,,1991, 1979 patient zero, so we first learned about the, you know
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.16,0:10:29.93,Default,,0,0,0,,the diagnoses, throughout the entire 80s it was all about the gays and the attics (?)
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.93,0:10:35.70,Default,,0,0,0,,and it was always, it's their problem, their personal responsibility, their behavior, their fault
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.70,0:10:39.13,Default,,0,0,0,,and then something happened in 1991, anybody remember what it was?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.13,0:10:42.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson got HIV
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.70,0:10:47.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and all of a sudden everyone went "Holly Mother…" you know what
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.80,0:10:54.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and everybody realized, you know what? everyone's at risk, and all of a sudden it became a public health crisis
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.06,0:11:00.06,Default,,0,0,0,,so when does a personal responsibility issue become a public health crisis? and that's what we're gonna talk about tonight
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.06,0:11:03.40,Default,,0,0,0,,because this is a public health crisis
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.76,0:11:08.03,Default,,0,0,0,,here's the slide that demonstrates the phenomenon
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.03,0:11:11.56,Default,,0,0,0,,so here are two equally weighted adult men
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.56,0:11:14.30,Default,,0,0,0,,which one's healthy and which one's sick
Dialogue: 0,0:11:14.30,0:11:16.40,Default,,0,0,0,,anybody know?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.86,0:11:21.23,Default,,0,0,0,,the one on the bottom is sick, right, he's sick
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.23,0:11:25.93,Default,,0,0,0,,why? All that visceral fat, all that fat surrounding the organs
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.93,0:11:29.73,Default,,0,0,0,,see this guy over here he's got big love handles, but you know, so what
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.73,0:11:35.40,Default,,0,0,0,,in fact, this is perfectly healthy, it's no problem, because subcutaneous fat is actually kinda good for you
Dialogue: 0,0:11:35.40,0:11:39.86,Default,,0,0,0,,there are actually studies that show more subcutaneous fat, more longevity
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.86,0:11:43.96,Default,,0,0,0,,whereas this stuff, this is the bad stuff, this is the poison stuff over here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.96,0:11:48.16,Default,,0,0,0,,so, the fact is, standing on a scale doesn't tell you where your fat is
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.16,0:11:49.86,Default,,0,0,0,,what does?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.86,0:11:58.40,Default,,0,0,0,,well your weight ??? is a good start, and then there's some lab tests you can do as well, the bottom line is there are a lot of normal weight people who have this phenomenon called TOFI
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.40,0:12:00.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Thin in the outside fat on the inside
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.40,0:12:03.40,Default,,0,0,0,,ok? Probably some right here in the audience
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.40,0:12:08.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and they get type-2 diabetes, they get dyslipidemia, they get hypertension, etc, etc, you get the picture?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.23,0:12:14.73,Default,,0,0,0,,everyone's at risk, because everyone's exposed, the question is, what it is you're exposed to?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.73,0:12:19.23,Default,,0,0,0,,because obesity is not the problem, it never was
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.23,0:12:22.93,Default,,0,0,0,,they want you to think it's the problem, but it ain't the problem
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.93,0:12:26.30,Default,,0,0,0,,what is the problem? Metabolic syndrome is the problem
Dialogue: 0,0:12:26.30,0:12:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,the cluster of diseases that I've just described you, 'cause that's where all the money goes
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.40,0:12:36.06,Default,,0,0,0,,obesity cost almost nothing, metabolic syndrome is 75 percent of all health-care costs today
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.06,0:12:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and there's the list right there, everyone with me now? Ok, do I have your attention? Ok
Dialogue: 0,0:12:42.00,0:12:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So how does this work? So this actually is a redundancy from the previous Youtube video so I apologize for that
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.36,0:12:54.23,Default,,0,0,0,,it has to do with how you view the question of obesity and what does it mean, so
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.23,0:12:58.20,Default,,0,0,0,,of course obesity obeys the first law of thermodynamics, and I don't argue that

Dialogue: 0,0:17:45.33,0:17:48.46,Default,,0,0,0,,so you say, well there's your answer, that's why everyone's obese
Dialogue: 0,0:17:48.46,0:17:53.56,Default,,0,0,0,,because they're eating too much and they're exercising too little, gluttony and sloth, diet and exercise

Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.40,0:18:08.26,Default,,0,0,0,,because education consists mainly of what we have unlearned

Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.66,0:18:32.93,Default,,0,0,0,,so, is this behavior, is this personal responsibility? what do you think
Dialogue: 0,0:18:32.93,0:18:35.70,Default,,0,0,0,,there are 6 reasons to doubt this
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.70,0:18:39.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Number 1: no child chooses to be obese
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.16,0:18:44.26,Default,,0,0,0,,the quality of an obese… life of an obese child is the same as a patient on cancer chemotherapy

Dialogue: 0,0:18:56.63,0:19:02.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and the number of people who can actually maintain their weight loss for any length of time is vanishingly small
Dialogue: 0,0:19:02.46,0:19:08.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and if it weren't true you wouldn't be sitting here listening to me, because you'd say, well why do I have to listen to him?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:08.26,0:19:10.53,Default,,0,0,0,,Does exercise work? So,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:10.53,0:19:19.73,Default,,0,0,0,,here are studies of exercise and this is the identity line here and you can see when compared with no treatment exercise resulted in very small weight loss across the board
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.73,0:19:23.60,Default,,0,0,0,,one BMI point, bigger exercise 1.5 BMI points
Dialogue: 0,0:19:23.60,0:19:27.16,Default,,0,0,0,,considering, we are all 7 to 8 BMI points more than we should be
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.16,0:19:35.90,Default,,0,0,0,,you know, that ain't gonna cut it, because exercise does not cause weight loss. Does not cause weight loss.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.90,0:19:40.56,Default,,0,0,0,,What does exercise do? It causes muscle gain, and that's good
Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.56,0:19:44.66,Default,,0,0,0,,because muscles have mitochondria, mitochondria burn energy
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.66,0:19:50.90,Default,,0,0,0,,so you stay insulin sensitive because you have a place to put your energy instead of in your liver where it causes problems
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.90,0:19:58.33,Default,,0,0,0,,so, exercise is the single best thing you can do for yourself, but if you think it's gonna show up on the scale, think again
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.33,0:20:03.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You're measuring 4 compartments at once
Dialogue: 0,0:20:03.33,0:20:06.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Bone, more is better
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.30,0:20:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Muscle, more is better
Dialogue: 0,0:20:09.00,0:20:14.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Subcutaneous fat, more is better, I just showed you
Dialogue: 0,0:20:14.26,0:20:18.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and finally visceral fat, more is worse
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.43,0:20:22.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Now the visceral fat usually ac compasses about 4 to 6 percent of your total body weight
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.23,0:20:26.66,Default,,0,0,0,,so when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You don't know, you can't possibly know
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.66,0:20:33.90,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we have all these doctors telling their patients, well if you'd only exercise you'd lose weight, and then of course they don't
Dialogue: 0,0:20:33.90,0:20:38.50,Default,,0,0,0,,because they've built muscle, which is good, but it doesn't show up on the scale
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.50,0:20:45.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and then they get depressed, because, oh, I was doing this to lose weight and it didn't work, and so I might as well stop because obviously it doesn't work for me
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.86,0:20:52.90,Default,,0,0,0,,this is the single most egregious thing doctors do to their patients today, and as far as I'm concerned, that's almost malpractice
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.90,0:20:57.90,Default,,0,0,0,,because the data say otherwise
Dialogue: 0,0:20:57.90,0:21:02.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Number 3, this isn't just about America
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.23,0:21:07.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's not just about UK, it's not just about Australia, yes we are the 3 fattest countries
Dialogue: 0,0:21:07.36,0:21:11.30,Default,,0,0,0,,and we spent the least amount of our GDP on food, that's true
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.30,0:21:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,but it's going on everywhere, every country, every single country on the planet has shown an uptick in obesity
Dialogue: 0,0:21:18.60,0:21:22.26,Default,,0,0,0,,some have shown an uptick in diabetes and some have shown a downtick
Dialogue: 0,0:21:22.26,0:21:28.76,Default,,0,0,0,,but for obesity, everybody's going up, doesn't matter where you look, every country has shown an increase
Dialogue: 0,0:21:28.76,0:21:32.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Number 4, the poor are disproportionately affected
Dialogue: 0,0:21:32.83,0:21:37.03,Default,,0,0,0,,and they don't have access to choices, they can't even leave their house for fear of crime
Dialogue: 0,0:21:37.03,0:21:43.40,Default,,0,0,0,,how they'gonna exercise, how they're gonna let their kids out, to go play in the yard, when they might, you know, face a straight bullet
Dialogue: 0,0:21:43.40,0:21:50.96,Default,,0,0,0,,they don't have a supermarkets, they live in food desserts, so if you don't have a choice, how can you call it personal responsibility?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:50.96,0:21:56.90,Default,,0,0,0,,You know, this is one of the most egregious, pejorative statements that there is
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.90,0:22:02.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Number 5, the prevalence of obesity is going up in the group
Dialogue: 0,0:22:02.46,0:22:06.56,Default,,0,0,0,,that you can least ascribe personal responsibility to, the toddler
Dialogue: 0,0:22:06.56,0:22:11.96,Default,,0,0,0,,the 2-5 year old group is going up the fastest, you wanna say that that's personal respons… oh you say
Dialogue: 0,0:22:11.96,0:22:17.46,Default,,0,0,0,,the personal responsibility of the parent, right, for letting them have the sugar pops and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:17.46,0:22:21.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and you know, and the sodas, and the fruit juices, and everything else is, parents' fault
Dialogue: 0,0:22:21.00,0:22:26.46,Default,,0,0,0,,except for one thing, we've been having an epidemic of obese 6 months olds, and they don't diet and exercise
Dialogue: 0,0:22:26.46,0:22:31.06,Default,,0,0,0,,so any hypothesis you wanna proffer, you have to explain this as well
Dialogue: 0,0:22:31.06,0:22:36.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's even worse than that, because we have obesity in newborns
Dialogue: 0,0:22:36.76,0:22:42.36,Default,,0,0,0,,newborns, ok? Birth weights gone up by 200 grams all over the world
Dialogue: 0,0:22:42.36,0:22:49.03,Default,,0,0,0,,all over the world over the last 25 years, and when you look at, when you do dexa scans to figure out what the body composition is
Dialogue: 0,0:22:49.03,0:22:51.63,Default,,0,0,0,,it's all fat, it's all fat
Dialogue: 0,0:22:51.63,0:22:57.76,Default,,0,0,0,,so there, these babies are laying down more fat before they're ever born and fat cells wanna get filled
Dialogue: 0,0:22:57.76,0:23:04.96,Default,,0,0,0,,that's why we have obese 6 months old, because everybody is laying down more fat, so the question is how? Why?

Dialogue: 0,0:23:07.96,0:23:10.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Most clearly, mother's diet
Dialogue: 0,0:23:10.53,0:23:13.96,Default,,0,0,0,,But you wanna blame the newborn for that problem?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:13.96,0:23:16.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that their problem? Is that their fault?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:16.76,0:23:22.53,Default,,0,0,0,,So you wanna blame the pregnant mother? Well you know… then, just go backwards like that, so basically blame everybody
Dialogue: 0,0:23:22.53,0:23:28.93,Default,,0,0,0,,or blame nobody, I blame nobody. Actually I do blame somebody but you're gonna get there by the end
Dialogue: 0,0:23:28.93,0:23:35.10,Default,,0,0,0,,So we are talking about behavior, right? Behavior, so this is the definition of behavior, this is all from the original video

Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.10,0:23:44.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Stereotyped, same every time, so, yes, eating is a behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:23:44.10,0:23:47.20,Default,,0,0,0,,motor, muscles have to move, a thought is not a behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:23:47.20,0:23:49.83,Default,,0,0,0,,and finally, physiological, and that's where I come in
Dialogue: 0,0:23:49.83,0:23:56.63,Default,,0,0,0,,What's the physiology behind the obesity epidemic? Why do you eat too much and exercise too little?
Dialogue: 0,0:23:56.63,0:23:59.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Because all behaviors have a biochemical basis

Dialogue: 0,0:24:06.83,0:24:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,For a 100 years schizophrenia was behavioral disorder, now we know it's a defect in dopamine neuro transmission, and probably actually a defect in glucose transport across the brain

Dialogue: 0,0:24:22.93,0:24:29.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So what are the biochemical underpinnings behind gluttony and sloth? That's the question, and that's what we're gonna try to answer now
Dialogue: 0,0:24:29.26,0:24:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So in order to answer that we have to know some science, and I'm gonna make this very brief and very quick
Dialogue: 0,0:24:35.33,0:24:38.76,Default,,0,0,0,,We're gonna talk about these two hormones right over here, called leptin and insulin
Dialogue: 0,0:24:38.76,0:24:48.26,Default,,0,0,0,,so leptin is a hormone that comes from your fat cell, goes to your brain and tells your brain, you have enough energy on board, to engage in normal, expensive metabolic processes
Dialogue: 0,0:24:48.26,0:24:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,you can burn energy at a normal rate and feel good doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.50,0:25:00.73,Default,,0,0,0,,ok? And tells your brain, you've got enough energy on board, if your leptin goes down, or if your brain doesn't see your leptin, then your brain sees that as starvation
Dialogue: 0,0:25:00.73,0:25:03.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Everybody got that?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.30,0:25:10.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Insulin is equally interesting, because insulin tells your fat cell one thing, it says, store energy
Dialogue: 0,0:25:10.60,0:25:14.86,Default,,0,0,0,,and it tells your brain something else, it tells your brain: stop
Dialogue: 0,0:25:14.86,0:25:21.30,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm in the middle of metabolizing a meal, I don't need any more, let me deal with what I've got, and so it's part of the satiety signal
Dialogue: 0,0:25:21.30,0:25:28.23,Default,,0,0,0,,so it tells you… fat cell, get bigger and it tells your brain, stop feeding your fat cell
Dialogue: 0,0:25:28.23,0:25:33.00,Default,,0,0,0,,so, it's got a dichotomist role, and it's that dichotomist role that is the linchpin
Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.00,0:25:36.40,Default,,0,0,0,,in terms of understanding the physiology of obesity
Dialogue: 0,0:25:36.40,0:25:42.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and I'm gonna get… we're gonna go there. So here's how it works, let's… we have to explain a paradox, here's the paradox
Dialogue: 0,0:25:42.23,0:25:44.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Who has children?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:44.20,0:25:48.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Enough of you. What happens if you give a 5 year old kid a cookie?
Dialogue: 0,0:25:48.63,0:25:54.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, they eat it, yeah, I know they eat it, what happens after that…
Dialogue: 0,0:25:54.83,0:26:02.63,Default,,0,0,0,,they bounce of walls, is what they do, ask any kindergarten teacher what happens when the cupcakes roll out for the birthday party
Dialogue: 0,0:26:02.63,0:26:07.03,Default,,0,0,0,,ok? That's the end of the lesson, ok? They are bouncing off walls, is known as the sugar high
Dialogue: 0,0:26:07.03,0:26:10.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so what's going on, the fat cell gets filled, you know, because of the coookie, 
Dialogue: 0,0:26:10.96,0:26:19.16,Default,,0,0,0,,the leptin goes up, tells the brain "hey, I've got extra energy on board", it tells the sympathetic nerve system, the fighter/flight part of the nerve system
Dialogue: 0,0:26:19.16,0:26:29.16,Default,,0,0,0,,that innervates your muscles, and innervates your fat cells, "hey, I got too much energy", so what happens? you burn it off, so the sympathetic nerve system tone to the muscles give you the fidgeting
Dialogue: 0,0:26:29.16,0:26:34.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and the sympathetic nerve system tone to the fat cells releases the extra fat
Dialogue: 0,0:26:34.46,0:26:39.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and that gets used for energy later, and so this is a nice negative feedback pathway
Dialogue: 0,0:26:39.33,0:26:43.76,Default,,0,0,0,,that keeps you in energy balance as long as your brain can see its leptin
Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.76,0:26:52.23,Default,,0,0,0,,so far so good, so here's the paradox? What happens if you give an obese 5 year old kid a cookie instead?
Dialogue: 0,0:26:52.23,0:26:55.40,Default,,0,0,0,,They are in the pantry looking for more cookies
Dialogue: 0,0:26:55.40,0:27:00.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Anybody ever see a sugar high in an obese kid? Doesn't exist, doesn't exist
Dialogue: 0,0:27:00.70,0:27:06.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and that's why they are obese, it's because they don't get the sugar high, because they can't see their leptin
Dialogue: 0,0:27:06.43,0:27:11.43,Default,,0,0,0,,'cause if they could see their leptin they'd have a sugar high. But they don't, that's the point
Dialogue: 0,0:27:11.43,0:27:16.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so something is blocking that leptin signal, that's the paradox, the question is, what is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.96,0:27:20.93,Default,,0,0,0,,So we learned about leptin from this patient over here, ok?
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.93,0:27:27.43,Default,,0,0,0,,This is the obi obi mouse, the leptin deficient mouse, who has a gene defect in the leptin gene, so this
Dialogue: 0,0:27:27.43,0:27:30.36,Default,,0,0,0,,animal's leptin is zero
Dialogue: 0,0:27:30.36,0:27:34.40,Default,,0,0,0,,so his brain thinks he's starving all the time, so he'll eat anything in sight
Dialogue: 0,0:27:34.40,0:27:38.86,Default,,0,0,0,,not only will he eat anything in sight, but this animal is the ultimate couch potato
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.86,0:27:45.16,Default,,0,0,0,,because his brain can't see his leptin, so he thinks he's starving, so he doesn't want to burn energy, he wants to store it
Dialogue: 0,0:27:45.16,0:27:51.53,Default,,0,0,0,,so, the only reason this animal ever gets off his hind is if you put the food on the other side of the cage, and they'll waddle over to that
Dialogue: 0,0:27:51.53,0:27:57.26,Default,,0,0,0,,sit down, eat it there, and stay there instead. Ok, everybody got it? Now,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:57.26,0:28:02.36,Default,,0,0,0,,the reason? Because leptin tells the hypothalamus that you've got the energy to burn
Dialogue: 0,0:28:02.36,0:28:10.23,Default,,0,0,0,,so if the hypothalamus sees the leptin signal, then this diamond over here gets activated
Dialogue: 0,0:28:10.23,0:28:15.80,Default,,0,0,0,,anorexigenesis, that is, I'm not hungry, I don't need any more, and I can burn energy effectively
Dialogue: 0,0:28:15.80,0:28:21.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and so it tells the sympathetic nerve system turn on to fidget and to release fat from the fat cell
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.60,0:28:31.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and it tells the vagus nerve, the energy storage nerve, "hey, I'm not hungry, appetite down, and stop releasing insulin". Everybody with me?
Dialogue: 0,0:28:31.23,0:28:36.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Conversely if the leptin doesn't reach the hypothalamus, because there is a gene deletion or there is something blocking it
Dialogue: 0,0:28:36.86,0:28:40.70,Default,,0,0,0,,then you get this diamond instead, which is orexigenesis
Dialogue: 0,0:28:40.70,0:28:50.36,Default,,0,0,0,,"I'm hungry, I need more food, because I'm starving, and because I'm starving I'm going to try to conserve"
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.36,0:28:55.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and so that means your sympathetic nerve system tone goes down, which means you sit on a log
Dialogue: 0,0:28:55.90,0:29:06.43,Default,,0,0,0,,and your vagus nerve goes up to increase your appetite, so that you'll generate more calories in order to put more into the fat cells to try to get more of a leptin signal, everybody with me?
Dialogue: 0,0:29:06.43,0:29:11.93,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is that same negative feedback pathway I showed you before, now schematized
Dialogue: 0,0:29:12.96,0:29:18.30,Default,,0,0,0,,and there are leptin deficient people, 14 at last count, 14
Dialogue: 0,0:29:18.30,0:29:23.23,Default,,0,0,0,,and they're all of consanguineous marriages and they're all of Pakistani or Turkish ancestry
Dialogue: 0,0:29:23.23,0:29:26.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and when they're born the are perfectly normal weight
Dialogue: 0,0:29:26.06,0:29:29.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and by age six months they are already massively obese
Dialogue: 0,0:29:29.06,0:29:33.50,Default,,0,0,0,,because their brain is constantly starving, it doesn't matter how much weight they gain
Dialogue: 0,0:29:33.50,0:29:38.30,Default,,0,0,0,,their brain can't see it, because it ain't there, because they have a leptin gene defect
Dialogue: 0,0:29:38.30,0:29:44.16,Default,,0,0,0,,so here's a patient, 220 pounds by age 9
Dialogue: 0,0:29:44.16,0:29:48.23,Default,,0,0,0,,but you start giving them shots of leptin every day and look what happens, they lose weight on a dime
Dialogue: 0,0:29:48.23,0:29:50.83,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's all fat mass that they are losing too
Dialogue: 0,0:29:50.83,0:29:59.26,Default,,0,0,0,,hormone replacement therapy, because now the brain can see leptin because we are giving it to them from a bottle instead of from their own fat cell
Dialogue: 0,0:29:59.26,0:30:02.66,Default,,0,0,0,,hormone replacement therapy, that's what I do as an endocrinologist, that's my job
Dialogue: 0,0:30:02.66,0:30:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and here's an example, here's the patient at 3 and half years of age, looking pretty awful
Dialogue: 0,0:30:08.16,0:30:13.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and here's after a shot of leptin every day for 4 years, indistinguishable from normal
Dialogue: 0,0:30:13.36,0:30:17.76,Default,,0,0,0,,because we fixed the problem, great right? For those 14 people
Dialogue: 0,0:30:17.76,0:30:23.00,Default,,0,0,0,,The problem is the rest of us are not leptin deficient, the rest of us are leptin resistant
Dialogue: 0,0:30:23.00,0:30:27.30,Default,,0,0,0,,we got boatloads of leptin, and the leptin correlates with how much body fat we have
Dialogue: 0,0:30:27.30,0:30:32.23,Default,,0,0,0,,but if our brain could see that leptin we wouldn't be obese
Dialogue: 0,0:30:32.23,0:30:35.76,Default,,0,0,0,,because we'd burn it off in the sugar high, right? Everybody got it?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.76,0:30:40.83,Default,,0,0,0,,So there's something blocking that signaling right there, that X
Dialogue: 0,0:30:40.83,0:30:46.16,Default,,0,0,0,,that's the holy grail of obesity, right there, what is blocking leptin from working
Dialogue: 0,0:30:46.16,0:30:56.16,Default,,0,0,0,,'cause if you can't… if your hypothalamus can't see it, then you are in this box over here, and you can see things just go in the wrong direction, and there's your gluttony and there is your sloth
Dialogue: 0,0:30:56.16,0:30:59.63,Default,,0,0,0,,so this is all biochemical
Dialogue: 0,0:30:59.63,0:31:05.60,Default,,0,0,0,,so, what role does insulin play in this leptin debacle? That's the question, remember I told you
Dialogue: 0,0:31:05.60,0:31:09.73,Default,,0,0,0,,insulin tells your fat cell one thing, and your brain the exact opposite
Dialogue: 0,0:31:09.73,0:31:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,it tells your fat cell store, and tells your brain stop. That's the problem
Dialogue: 0,0:31:15.60,0:31:23.33,Default,,0,0,0,,So, this is the patient that got me started in obesity research, now 18 years ago, when I worked at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis
Dialogue: 0,0:31:23.33,0:31:27.91,Default,,0,0,0,,this was a 15 year old boy, who weights 364 pounds in this photo
Dialogue: 0,0:31:27.91,0:31:35.51,Default,,0,0,0,,and at age 7 this kid was perfectly normal weight for height, and then he developed this brain tumor sitting in the middle of his energy balance pathway
Dialogue: 0,0:31:35.51,0:31:41.91,Default,,0,0,0,,and he required surgery, and he required radiation to kill this astrocytoma, tumor of the brain
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.91,0:31:46.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and he started gaining weight at the rate of 30 pounds per year non stop
Dialogue: 0,0:31:46.84,0:31:51.82,Default,,0,0,0,,for 8 years until he was 364 pounds and I saw him, ok, everybody with me?
Dialogue: 0,0:31:51.82,0:31:56.93,Default,,0,0,0,,now, this form of intractable obesity due to a brain lesion
Dialogue: 0,0:31:56.93,0:32:00.93,Default,,0,0,0,,now that area of the brain that controls this energy balance is dead
Dialogue: 0,0:32:00.93,0:32:06.17,Default,,0,0,0,,so you can have all the leptin in the world but if those neurons are dead, your brain thinks its starving
Dialogue: 0,0:32:06.17,0:32:08.22,Default,,0,0,0,,because it can't transduce that signal
Dialogue: 0,0:32:08.22,0:32:14.17,Default,,0,0,0,,so this is called hypothalamic obesity and this is how I got started in obesity research many many years ago, ok?
Dialogue: 0,0:32:14.17,0:32:18.66,Default,,0,0,0,,So the question is how does this happen, well here are two different hypothesis
Dialogue: 0,0:32:18.66,0:32:25.51,Default,,0,0,0,,This hypothesis says well you damage the hypothalamus and you get obesity because it releases a satiety center
Dialogue: 0,0:32:25.51,0:32:33.28,Default,,0,0,0,,so now you become hyperphagic, except the data actually doesn't support that, the date doesn't support that there's hyperphagia, that there is too much food intake
Dialogue: 0,0:32:33.20,0:32:37.28,Default,,0,0,0,,actually it supports that there's too little burning, that's what it shows
Dialogue: 0,0:32:37.28,0:32:43.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and that the obesity occurs and then, because of the obesity you have to secret more insulin to tend all that fat
Dialogue: 0,0:32:43.60,0:32:46.62,Default,,0,0,0,,and so that the insulin here is a result of the obesity
Dialogue: 0,0:32:46.62,0:32:51.55,Default,,0,0,0,,but there's this other hypothesis over here that says, the damage to the hypothalamus yes, it leads to obesity,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:51.64,0:32:55.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but because it turns on that vagus nerve, because you can't see your leptin
Dialogue: 0,0:32:55.64,0:33:02.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and when you turn on the vagus nerve that tells your pancreas to release more insulin, and that extra insulin drives energy into fat
Dialogue: 0,0:33:02.08,0:33:05.46,Default,,0,0,0,,energy deposition, not energy balance
Dialogue: 0,0:33:05.46,0:33:10.75,Default,,0,0,0,,because of the high insulin, and the insulin is driving the obesity, so which is true?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:10.75,0:33:15.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Well if this is true, nothing I can do about it, 'cause I can't fix a brain
Dialogue: 0,0:33:15.28,0:33:22.40,Default,,0,0,0,,If this is true it gives me a place I can potentially intervene, right between the vagus nerve and the pancreas
Dialogue: 0,0:33:22.40,0:33:27.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and we have a drug that does that, and it's called Octeotride, and it's an endocrine drug that I know how to use
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.68,0:33:32.44,Default,,0,0,0,,and so we asked the question, if we take these kids who have this intractable obesity due to brain tumors
Dialogue: 0,0:33:32.44,0:33:38.35,Default,,0,0,0,,and we give them this drug to suppress their insulin, might it help? That was the question
Dialogue: 0,0:33:38.35,0:33:45.91,Default,,0,0,0,,So here's that same patient I showed you, 364 pounds, and here is a year later 326 first time he took a picture with his shirt off
Dialogue: 0,0:33:45.91,0:33:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,so he did pretty well, ok, I'm gonna show you the ??? over here, this isn't even my patient
Dialogue: 0,0:33:51.68,0:33:58.04,Default,,0,0,0,,this is a beautiful 13 year old girl from Hawaii, notice the flower, ok?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:58.04,0:34:03.95,Default,,0,0,0,,who, like a month after this picture was taken, was in a very severe car accident
Dialogue: 0,0:34:03.95,0:34:09.28,Default,,0,0,0,,on a Honolulu road, and she was in the intensive care unit for a month 
Dialogue: 0,0:34:09.28,0:34:15.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and she survived but she struck her hypothalamus, and so this is her a year later
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.46,0:34:20.04,Default,,0,0,0,,now, does anybody wanna tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:20.04,0:34:23.64,Default,,0,0,0,,This kid now can't see her leptin because those neurons are dead
Dialogue: 0,0:34:23.64,0:34:28.22,Default,,0,0,0,,now just so happens I happened to be giving ground rounds at ? Honolulu in 2008
Dialogue: 0,0:34:28.22,0:34:32.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and so they invited the patient and her mother to come to the talk
Dialogue: 0,0:34:32.04,0:34:36.71,Default,,0,0,0,,because they were thinking about putting this kid on a ??? even though she'd never' a brain tumor
Dialogue: 0,0:34:36.71,0:34:39.82,Default,,0,0,0,,because she might have the same disorder, and so there I am with her
Dialogue: 0,0:34:39.82,0:34:44.75,Default,,0,0,0,,and here she is a year and a half later, on the drug, at her high school graduation
Dialogue: 0,0:34:44.75,0:34:50.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, who here wants to tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:50.84,0:34:54.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Do I have your attention? Ok, it's never gluttony and sloth
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.88,0:35:01.55,Default,,0,0,0,,It's always biochemical, the question is are you smart enough to figure out what the biochemistry is
Dialogue: 0,0:35:01.55,0:35:08.31,Default,,0,0,0,,So we said, maybe this could be true in adult obesity without brain tumors or without hypothalamic damage?
Dialogue: 0,0:35:08.31,0:35:12.53,Default,,0,0,0,,So we did a study, actually 2 studies, double blind placebo controlled,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:12.53,0:35:17.28,Default,,0,0,0,,this is a patient, adult, Christmas 1998 holding up food
Dialogue: 0,0:35:17.28,0:35:24.62,Default,,0,0,0,,and here she is 35 pounds later, in her jogging togs, showing me that she wanted to exercise
Dialogue: 0,0:35:24.62,0:35:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,she actually wanted to exercise, and the reason was because she wasn't storing it
Dialogue: 0,0:35:29.46,0:35:32.48,Default,,0,0,0,,because her insulin went down, because the drug suppressed her insulin
Dialogue: 0,0:35:32.48,0:35:35.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and when her insulin when down, she had the energy to burn
Dialogue: 0,0:35:35.86,0:35:38.66,Default,,0,0,0,,and she wanted to, and she did
Dialogue: 0,0:35:38.66,0:35:45.73,Default,,0,0,0,,and she's showing you, right here, that the change in the biochemistry changed her behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:35:45.73,0:35:49.28,Default,,0,0,0,,the biochemistry drives the behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:35:49.28,0:35:55.11,Default,,0,0,0,,so, the cause of leptin resistance, that X up here? It's insulin
Dialogue: 0,0:35:55.11,0:36:01.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and there's actually numerous studies now, biochemical, molecular, genetic, that show
Dialogue: 0,0:36:01.33,0:36:06.97,Default,,0,0,0,,that insulin blocks leptin signaling by acting on the same neurons in the brain as leptin does
Dialogue: 0,0:36:06.97,0:36:12.62,Default,,0,0,0,,and that's the point, insulin blocks leptin signaling, now why?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:12.62,0:36:16.62,Default,,0,0,0,,What's in it for us, why would God do this to us?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:16.62,0:36:21.68,Default,,0,0,0,,And the answer is because there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, what are they?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.68,0:36:26.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Pregnancy is one, and the other is puberty
Dialogue: 0,0:36:26.13,0:36:30.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Puberty and pregnancy, both necessary for survival of the species
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.26,0:36:35.51,Default,,0,0,0,,If your leptin worked right all the time, you could never gain the weight
Dialogue: 0,0:36:35.51,0:36:40.31,Default,,0,0,0,,because you'd be in the sugar high, you'd be burning it off before you ever had a chance to actually gain weight
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.31,0:36:44.44,Default,,0,0,0,,you'd be the 97 pound weakling on the beach who couldn't bulk up
Dialogue: 0,0:36:44.44,0:36:46.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and the species would die out
Dialogue: 0,0:36:46.80,0:36:53.20,Default,,0,0,0,,so there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, and both puberty and pregnancy are insulin resistant states
Dialogue: 0,0:36:53.20,0:36:57.11,Default,,0,0,0,,where your insulin goes high very specifically to cause the weight gain
Dialogue: 0,0:36:57.11,0:37:01.60,Default,,0,0,0,,then, you cut the cord, baby's out, sex hormones go back down,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:01.60,0:37:05.91,Default,,0,0,0,,the insulin resistance goes away, you lose the weight and you can start all over again
Dialogue: 0,0:37:05.91,0:37:11.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So it actually makes perfect Darwinian sense that insulin should block leptin
Dialogue: 0,0:37:11.20,0:37:13.95,Default,,0,0,0,,Twice in your life
Dialogue: 0,0:37:13.95,0:37:17.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Twice in your life, insulin should block leptin
Dialogue: 0,0:37:17.91,0:37:20.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Problem is, now it blocks leptin all the time
Dialogue: 0,0:37:20.88,0:37:24.88,Default,,0,0,0,,'Cause our insulins are high, 24/7/365
