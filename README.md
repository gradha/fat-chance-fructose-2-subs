Fat chance, fructose 2.0 subs
=============================

This repository contains the work in progress subs for the youtube video [Fat
Chance: Fructose 2.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFyF9px20Y) youtube
video. The purpose of the repo is to first transcribe the video, then translate
it to Spanish.

I have no idea of what I'm doing, so feel free to correct me. I'm using the
program [Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org) for the first time, which produces
``.ass`` files. I wonder how will I upload these to youtube laterâ€¦

BTW: Under Macosx you have to use case sensitive bindings for the hotkeys,
where case sensitive applies to the letter: Ctrl-r will bind to the control
key, Ctrl-R will instead bind to both the control and command key.
