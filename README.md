Fat chance, fructose 2.0 subs
=============================

This repository contains the work in progress subs for the youtube video [Fat
Chance: Fructose 2.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFyF9px20Y) youtube
video. The purpose of the repo is to first transcribe the video, then translate
it to Spanish. If you want to translate the English version you can fork away
this repo and make pull requests to contribute back. Or just [use the github
issue tracker](https://github.com/gradha/fat-chance-fructose-2-subs/issues) to
request changes or submit your own version.

Remember that having the subs here doesn't guarantee inclusion in the
*upstream* video. You need to [contact UCTV](mailto:uctv@ucsd.edu). They are
the copyright holders and only ones who can change the subtitles of the youtube
video.

For transcription and translation I'm using the program
[Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org) for the first time, which produces ``.ass``
files. You can get the [ass file](Fat chance, fructose 2.0.en.ass) or download
the [srt file](Fat chance, fructose 2.0.en.srt) which seems to be the format
used by most players.

By the way, Under Macosx you have to use case sensitive bindings for the
hotkeys in Aegisub, where case sensitive applies to the letter: Ctrl-r will
bind to the control key, Ctrl-R will instead bind to both the control and
command key.
