Fat chance, fructose 2.0 subs
=============================

This repository contains the work in progress subs for the youtube video [Fat
Chance: Fructose 2.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceFyF9px20Y) youtube
video. The purpose of the repo is to first transcribe the video, then translate
it to Spanish.

I have no idea of what I'm doing, so feel free to correct me. I'm using the
program [Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org) for the first time, which produces
``.ass`` files. You can get the [ass file](Fat chance, fructose 2.0.ass) or
download the [srt file](Fat chance, fructose 2.0.srt) which seems to be the
format used by most players.

By the way, Under Macosx you have to use case sensitive bindings for the
hotkeys in Aegisub, where case sensitive applies to the letter: Ctrl-r will
bind to the control key, Ctrl-R will instead bind to both the control and
command key.
