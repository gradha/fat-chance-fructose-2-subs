Good evenening every one. Welcome again to our penultimate class in this semesters' course on nutrition

4
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,220
a reminder that next week we will be talking about vitamins and minerals and vitamin and mineral supplements so please join us for that last class

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,080
Dr Jeffrey Thais will be the professor joining us that evening

6
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,800
tonight we have what I guess for some of you has been the lecture you've been waiting for since the beginning

7
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,740
Dr Lustig gave a similar lecture in 2009

8
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,180
little did we know at the time that it would have 3.5 million downloads

9
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,360
since then but also in this room at a course very similar to this that I also chaired

10
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,120
and it's really... I think changed his life more than anything else but I think the hope is, that… it's also

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,730
changed the field and the topic and the policies and the politics that we are going to talk about tonight

12
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:07,330
many of you know Dr. Lustig is an internationally known neuroendicronologist in pediatrics

13
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:18,830
he trained for part of his time at UCSF then went back east to do a clinical neuroendicronology and came back to UCSF in 2001

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,430
where he's continued to do his clinical science

15
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,630
on factors that control appetite, particularly the interaction between

16
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,460
the hormones of insulin, leptin, ghrelin,

17
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,830
and appetite control and metabolic syndrome and obesity

18
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,200
more recently… in part around the time of the video and certainly in the four years since

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,700
Rob has become an international leader

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,800
in the efforts to improve our nutrition not only in the United States but around the world

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,900
he's focused a larger part by putting a real microscope on the issues of

22
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,360
fructose and sugar in general and refined foods in general

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,530
the relationship of the dietary fiber and the many of the other topics

24
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,730
that we've been talking about over the course of the course

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,860
Rob just returned from Europe

26
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,260
this morning, in fact arrived here at 5 o'clock this evening

27
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,630
we think he had dinner, we know he hasn't had sleep, it's 4 o'clock Europe time for him so

28
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,460
this was really a heroic effort

29
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,100
our fingers were crossed that all the flights would be on time

30
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,000
and I'm very pleased more than you can imagine

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,660
that he's here tonight, 'cause I didn't wanna give this lecture as well

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,430
but in addition to his work, Rob recently took a sabbatical

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,460
in order to further this work and spend a large part of that time at his ? school of law

34
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,660
getting a Master of studies in Law

35
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,900
and part of his aspiration I think is really to add his legal training now

36
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
to his science and medical training

37
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,060
to continue to advocate for good nutrition around the world so

38
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,230
we're very anxious to hear about his newest thoughts on this topic

39
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,760
we've entitled the talk the same title as his best selling book

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,560
"Fat Chance" and added the subtitle "Fructose 2.0", Rob

41
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:41,700
Thank you Bobby and thank all of you for coming, you know, to some extent this is sort of like déjà vu all over again

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,900
you know having done this 4 years ago and it really did change my life and hopefully changed a few peoples' lifes

43
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,030
in the audience and certainly around the world

44
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,830
I still get emails from that video today, ah, you know, people who've seen it for the first time

45
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,460
that video we are gonna refer back to it in some, to some extent tonight

46
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,160
'cause I am not gonna redo the biochemestry, there's no point in doing it twice

47
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,460
what we're gonna talk tonight about is primarily the physiology

48
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,900
so, in essence, the two videos will end up being complementary on youtube

49
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,930
and hopefully people who watch it will end up watching both, so keep that in mind
so, in essence, the two videos will end up being complementary on youtube

50
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,600
and hopefully people who watch it will end up watching both, so keep that in mind

51
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:34,360
all right, well, a lot's happened in four years, and the data just keeps rolling in, and unfortunately for us all the data is pretty awful

52
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,060
so you'll see why as we go and I will try to delineate that as we go

53
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,930
so first of all I have no disclosures, no food industry is putting me up to this

54
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,300
you be sure of that

55
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,260
so here's the past, this is 2001

56
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,860
6 million kids are seriously overwheight, well

57
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,800
with all of the media attention, with all of the NIH money, with all of the clinical programs

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,900
and with Michelle Obama's vegetable gardens we are now up to 20 million

59
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,130
here's the present

60
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,660
currently there are 30% more obese people on the planet than undernourished people

61
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,960
and this has happened only within 15 years because 15 years ago was exactly the opposite

62
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,200
and it's occurring in countries that still have under nutrition

63
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,760
so how do you explain that, other than to say

64
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,800
that can't be behaviour, that's gotta be an exposure

65
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,500
this looks like any standard pandemic

66
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,060
influenza, typhoid, etc

67
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,530
this looks like a microbial phenomenon rather than a behavioral phenomenon, we're gonna go there

68
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,800
366 million diabetics walking the earth, that's 5% of the worlds' population

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,100
and they are chewing through all the health-care resources

70
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:59,500
this was just three months ago, diabetics cost the US 24 billion dollars

71
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,230
now if we could recoup even a fraction of that we wouldn't even need health-care reform

72
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,560
in fact it's been suggested that we wouldn't even need financial reform

73
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,330
ok, 41% rise in 5 years, this is going up so fast it makes your head spin

74
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,800
and here's the future if we do nothing

75
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,360
experts predict 165 million Americans, 42% would be obese by the year 2030

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,730
100 million Americans, that'll be 33%, will have diabetes by 2050

77
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,300
but fear not, because it won't really matter because Medicare will be broke by 2026

78
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,800
so, as the Soup Nazi once said: "No health-care for you"

79
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,930
well, the fact of the matter is, I'm gonna be 69 in 2026 and I want my fricking Medicare

80
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,260
and… so should you all

81
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,930
the point is, we have to do something different, and you know the old's adage, right?

82
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,900
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result

83
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,700
well I'm here to tell you for the last 30 years we've done the same thing over and over and over again

84
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,900
and there has been no change in the result

85
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,660
so we have to rethink this, we have to reframe the argument and that's what we are gonna try to do tonight

86
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,000
and I'm'a do it right now

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,860
so here's the way people view this issue

88
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,430
this is a Venn diagram of all the adults in America

89
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,400
30% obese over here, and 70% normal weight over here

90
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,260
and everybody assumes that the problem is this group over here because

91
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,130
80% of the obese population is sick in some fashion

92
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,460
with type-2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia,

93
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,960
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian disease, etc, etc

94
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,560
so, if you do the math on this, that's 80% of 30% of 240 million, that's 57 million sick

95
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,030
and it's those 57 million that are bankrupting the country

96
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,900
and so it's the obese person's fault only

97
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,160
and that's the way everyone views this

98
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,060
this is wrong, this is a mistake, this is a disaster actually, because it is not correct

99
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,630
here's the real story, in fact, 20% of the obese population is completely metabolically normal

100
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,060
they have normal insulin dynamics, they don't get sick,

101
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,230
they will live a completely normal life, die at a completely normal age,

102
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,960
cost the taxpayer nothing, they're just fat

103
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:37,060
conversely, up to 40% of the normal weight population have the exact same metabolic dysfunction

104
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,630
that the obese do, they are just normal weight, and so they don't even know they are sick, until it's too late

105
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:50,660
because, normal weight people get type-2 diabetes, they get hypertension, they get dyslipidemia, they get cardiovascular disease, they get cancer, they get dementia, etc, etc

106
00:09:50,660 --> 00:10:01,400
and so when you do the math on that, that's another 67 million, so that's actually outclassing the obese, and so the total is 124 million, that's more than half of all of America

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,430
Now, you may remember HIV

108
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:12,030
Remember HIV? When did HIV become a public health crisis?

109
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,000
No, not in the 80s

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,630
In the, in 1991

111
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,160
1991, 1979 patient zero, so we first learned about the, you know

112
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,930
the diagnosis, throughout the entire 80s it was all about the gays and the addicts

113
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,700
and it was always, it's their problem, their personal responsibility, their behavior, their fault

114
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,130
and then something happened in 1991, anybody remember what it was?

115
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,700
Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson got HIV

116
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,800
and all of a sudden everyone went "Holly Mother…" you know what

117
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,060
and everybody realized, you know what? everyone's at risk, and all of a sudden it became a public health crisis

118
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,060
so when does a personal responsibility issue become a public health crisis? and that's what we're gonna talk about tonight

119
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,400
because this is a public health crisis

120
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,030
here's the slide that demonstrates the phenomenon

121
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,560
so here are two equally weighted adult men

122
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,300
which one's healthy and which one's sick

123
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,400
anybody know?

124
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,230
the one on the bottom is sick, right, he's sick

125
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,930
why? All that visceral fat, all that fat surrounding the organs

126
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,730
see this guy over here he's got big love handles, but you know, so what?

127
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,400
in fact, this is perfectly healthy, it's no problem, because subcutaneous fat is actually kinda good for you

128
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,860
there are actually studies that show more subcutaneous fat, more longevity

129
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,960
whereas this stuff, this is the bad stuff, this is the poison stuff over here

130
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,160
so, the fact is, standing on a scale doesn't tell you where your fat is

131
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,860
what does?

132
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:58,400
well your waist circumference is a good start, and then there's some lab tests you can do as well, the bottom line is there are a lot of normal weight people who have this phenomenon called TOFI

133
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Thin in the outside fat on the inside

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
ok? Probably some right here in the audience

135
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,230
and they get type-2 diabetes, they get dyslipidemia, they get hypertension, etc, etc, you get the picture?

136
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,730
everyone's at risk, because everyone's exposed, the question is, what it is you're exposed to?

137
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,230
because obesity is not the problem, it never was

138
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,930
they want you to think it's the problem, but it ain't the problem

139
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,300
what is the problem? Metabolic syndrome is the problem

140
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,400
the cluster of diseases that I've just described you, 'cause that's where all the money goes

141
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,060
obesity cost almost nothing, metabolic syndrome is 75% of all health-care cost today

142
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,000
and there's the list right there, everyone with me now? Ok, do I have your attention? Ok

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,360
So how does this work? So this actually is a redundancy from the previous Youtube video so I apologize for that

144
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,230
it has to do with how you view the question of obesity and what does it mean, so

145
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,200
of course obesity obeys the first law of thermodynamics, and I don't argue that

146
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,230
the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. It's a law

147
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:11,760
ok, if I didn't believe in the first law of thermodynamics you'd have me written out on the rail, I'd be the ultimate heretic and zealot and I would be discredited

148
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,930
of course I believe in the first law of thermodynamics, it's a law

149
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:22,100
the question is, as I've learned from my legal training, who's truth, which interpretation

150
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,460
you know the Supreme Court always comes down 5-4 on everything, right, right?

151
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,630
True, ok, because there are two interpretations, I mean, basically that's what the Supreme Court is for, interpreting the law

152
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,600
the law is the law, but the interpretation is something else, so here are the two interpretations

153
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,430
If you eat it, you better burn it, or you gonna store it

154
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,630
if that's true, then this is a matter of energy balance

155
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,530
energy balance, that's what everyone will tell you

156
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:58,560
and it's the result of two aberrant behaviors, calories in - gluttony, calories out - sloth

157
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,800
and that's what everybody assumes, is, if you're obese, well you must eat too much or exercise too little, or both

158
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,700
and therefore, it's your fault

159
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,500
and that's what we believe and to this day we still don't have insurance for obesity

160
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:19,460
although just today, you know that the AMA finally said "obesity is a disease"

161
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,300
so it's funny, because actually in 2004 HHS said obesity is a disease

162
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,060
it took the AMA 9 years to catch up with HHS, figure that out

163
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:37,360
so the do… it's based on this dogma, the dogma is, that if you eat more than you burn you'll gain weight, if you eat less than you burn you'll lose weight

164
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,400
because all calories are the same, a calorie is a calorie

165
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,360
this is the biggest… pile of you-know-what there is

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,630
this is absolute not true

167
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,060
but if you believe it then the corollaries of a calorie is a calorie are

168
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:02,200
that this is free will, you get to choose what you get to put in your mouth, it's personal responsibility because if you are obese you chose to be

169
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,560
gluttony and sloth that is your problem and diet and exercise will fix it

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,400
that's what everyone believes from a calorie is a calorie

171
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,500
and who says that a calorie is a calorie, well?

172
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,100
the food industry says a calorie is a calorie, and that's 'cause it serves them well, so this is the fiction

173
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,260
this is Coca-Cola's coming together video on Youtube

174
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:33,430
released just before the Superbowl, that says: "Beating obesity will take action by all of us based on one simple common sense fact"

175
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:40,030
common sense fact, all calories count, no matter where they come from, including Coca-cola and everything else with calories, a calorie is a calorie

176
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:45,460
why pick on Coca-cola, why pick on Burger King, why pick on any individual

177
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,000
because it serves them well, because it diffuses the issue

178
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:57,400
so, is that what we've got? We've just gut a caloric bachanalia? Oh, sorry, wait, this is wrong, that's better, ok

179
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,360
Indeed we are all eating more, I don't argue that, 187 calories per day more for men,

180
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,960
335 calories per day more for women, 275 calories more per day for teen boys

181
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,160
than 25 years ago, we are all eating more, I don't argue that, of course we are, question is why

182
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:25,030
so you'd say, well this is why, this is the evolution of fast food over here, 1957 we had the original White Castle hamburger, 210 calories right there, 1 ounce

183
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,660
over here we have today's Bob's Big Boy over here at 618 calories

184
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,300
and of course in the midst of the obesity epidemic hardies had the temerity to offer us the Thickburger at 1420 calories

185
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,360
and of course you can go to Carls' Junior and get the 6$ burger, which is 2000 calories, that's the entire caloric allotment for the day

186
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,760
and people are proud to go do it, right?

187
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,660
How? Anybody here had a Trenta?

188
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,200
A Trenta, yes, no? Ok, so that's this guy over here

189
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,360
so it's not hot coffee, it's a cold coffee drink

190
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,960
flavored with you-know-what, and it is 916 cc

191
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,260
well, your stomach is 900cc, it's bigger than your stomach

192
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,600
so you'd say, well there's your answer, Q.E.D, it's all over right?

193
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
How about this? I love this, it's came in the mail

194
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,730
"Free chicken sandwich from KFC with the purchase of a 30 ounce drink"

195
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,800
the food's gotten so cheap we're are giving it away? That's where we are, ok

196
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,100
Or is it the opposite side of the equation? Is it an activity famine?

197
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,060
So this is a study that was done looking at physical activity here on the Y axis

198
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,730
against age, 9-years old to 19-years old, for white girls and black girls

199
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,560
so you can see that by the time they hit age 15 the black girls are just lying prostrate on the floor

200
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,330
'cause there's no physical activity whatsoever

201
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,460
so you say, well there's your answer, that's why everyone's obese

202
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,560
because they're eating too much and they're exercising too little, gluttony and sloth, diet and exercise

203
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,230
just like common sense tells you

204
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,630
well, you know what? I don't believe in common sense, I believe in data

205
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,400
Ok? And that's why we do research

206
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,260
because education consists mainly of what we have unlearned

207
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,630
in fact, if everything that we knew were true, there would be no reason for research, would there?

208
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,300
I would never have to do any research 'cause everything we knew was already right

209
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,630
In fact, everything we learned 10 years ago is already wrong, and everything we know today will be wrong 10 years from now

210
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,930
and that's why you do research, and the fact is the research tells us something very different

211
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,930
so, is this behavior, is this personal responsibility? What do you think?

212
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,700
there are 6 reasons to doubt this

213
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,160
Number 1: no child chooses to be obese

214
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,260
the quality of an obese… life of an obese child is the same as a patient on cancer chemotherapy

215
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,400
why would anyone choose this, in fact, children are ostracized

216
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,130
Does, second, does diet work? Now everybody knows somebody who lost weight on a diet

217
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,630
and then of course they gained it all back, and that's what all the data shows

218
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,460
and the number of people who can actually maintain their weight loss for any length of time is vanishingly small

219
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,260
and if it weren't true you wouldn't be sitting here listening to me, because you'd say, well why do I have to listen to him?

220
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,530
Does exercise work? So,

221
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:19,730
here are studies of exercise and this is the identity line here and you can see when compared with no treatment exercise resulted in very small weight loss across the board

222
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,600
one BMI point, bigger exercise 1.5 BMI points

223
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,160
considering, we are all 7 to 8 BMI points more than we should be

224
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:35,900
you know, that ain't gonna cut it, because exercise does not cause weight loss. Does not cause weight loss.

225
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,560
What does exercise do? It causes muscle gain, and that's good

226
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,660
because muscles have mitochondria, mitochondria burn energy

227
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:50,900
so you stay insulin sensitive because you have a place to put your energy instead of in your liver where it causes problems

228
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,330
so, exercise is the single best thing you can do for yourself, but if you think it's gonna show up on the scale, think again

229
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,330
So when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You're measuring 4 compartments at once

230
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,300
Bone, more is better

231
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,000
Muscle, more is better

232
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,260
Subcutaneous fat, more is better, I just showed you

233
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,430
and finally visceral fat, more is worse

234
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,230
Now the visceral fat usually accompasses about 4 to 6 percent of your total body weight

235
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,660
so when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You don't know, you can't possibly know

236
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,900
So, we have all these doctors telling their patients, well if you'd only exercise you'd lose weight, and then of course they don't

237
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,500
because they've built muscle, which is good, but it doesn't show up on the scale

238
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,860
and then they get depressed, because, oh, I was doing this to lose weight and it didn't work, and so I might as well stop because obviously it doesn't work for me

239
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,900
this is the single most egregious thing doctors do to their patients today, and as far as I'm concerned, that's almost malpractice

240
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,900
because the data say otherwise

241
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,230
Number 3, this isn't just about America

242
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,360
and it's not just about UK, it's not just about Australia, yes we are the 3 fattest countries

243
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,300
and we spent the least amount of our GDP on food, that's true

244
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:18,600
but it's going on everywhere, every country, every single country on the planet has shown an uptick in obesity

245
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,260
some have shown an uptick in diabetes and some have shown a downtick

246
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,760
but for obesity, everybody's going up, doesn't matter where you look, every country has shown an increase

247
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,830
Number 4, the poor are disproportionately affected

248
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,030
and they don't have access to choices, they can't even leave their house for fear of crime

249
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,400
how they'gonna exercise, how they're gonna let their kids out, to go play in the yard, when they might, you know, face a straight bullet

250
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,960
they don't have a supermarkets, they live in food desserts, so if you don't have a choice, how can you call it personal responsibility?

251
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,900
You know, this is one of the most egregious, pejorative statements that there is

252
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,460
Number 5, the prevalence of obesity is going up in the group

253
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,560
that you can least ascribe personal responsibility to, the toddler

254
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,960
the 2-5 year old group is going up the fastest, you wanna say that that's personal respons… oh you say

255
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,460
the personal responsibility of the parent, right, for letting them have the sugar pops and

256
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,000
and you know, and the sodas, and the fruit juices, and everything else is, parents' fault

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,460
except for one thing, we've been having an epidemic of obese 6 months olds, and they don't diet and exercise

258
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,060
so any hypothesis you wanna proffer, you have to explain this as well

259
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,760
and it's even worse than that, because we have obesity in newborns

260
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,360
newborns, ok? Birth weights gone up by 200 grams all over the world

261
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,030
all over the world over the last 25 years, and when you look at, when you do dexa scans to figure out what the body composition is

262
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,630
it's all fat, it's all fat

263
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,760
so there, these babies are laying down more fat before they're ever born and fat cells wanna get filled

264
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,960
that's why we have obese 6 months old, because everybody is laying down more fat, so the question is how? Why?

265
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
Why they are laying down more fat today?

266
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,100
Most clearly, mother's diet

267
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,960
But you wanna blame the newborn for that problem?

268
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,760
Is that their problem? Is that their fault?

269
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,530
So you wanna blame the pregnant mother? Well you know… then, just go backwards like that, so basically blame everybody

270
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:28,930
or blame nobody, I blame nobody. Actually I do blame somebody but you're gonna get there by the end

271
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:35,100
So we are talking about behavior, right? Behavior, so this is the definition of behavior, this is all from the original video

272
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,100
A stereotyped motor response to a physiological stimulus, so let's take that apart

273
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Stereotyped, same every time, so, yes, eating is a behavior

274
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,200
motor, muscles have to move, a thought is not a behavior

275
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,830
and finally, physiological, and that's where I come in

276
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:56,630
What's the physiology behind the obesity epidemic? Why do you eat too much and exercise too little?

277
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,730
Because all behaviors have a biochemical basis

278
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,130
Now sometimes we are smart enough to know what it is and sometimes we are not smart enough to know what it is

279
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,130
give you an example: schizophrenia

280
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:15,330
For a 100 years schizophrenia was behavioral disorder, now we know it's a defect in dopamine neuro transmission, and probably actually a defect in glucose transport across the brain

281
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:22,930
Ok? These are biochemical problems, that ultimately manifest themselves as a behavioral disorder, this is no different

282
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:29,260
So what are the biochemical underpinnings behind gluttony and sloth? That's the question, and that's what we're gonna try to answer now

283
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,330
So in order to answer that we have to know some science, and I'm gonna make this very brief and very quick

284
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,760
We're gonna talk about these two hormones right over here, called leptin and insulin

285
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:48,260
so leptin is a hormone that comes from your fat cell, goes to your brain and tells your brain, you have enough energy on board, to engage in normal, expensive metabolic processes

286
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,500
you can burn energy at a normal rate and feel good doing it

287
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:00,730
ok? And tells your brain, you've got enough energy on board, if your leptin goes down, or if your brain doesn't see your leptin, then your brain sees that as starvation

288
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,300
Everybody got that?

289
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:10,600
Insulin is equally interesting, because insulin tells your fat cell one thing, it says, store energy

290
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,860
and it tells your brain something else, it tells your brain: stop

291
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm in the middle of metabolizing a meal, I don't need any more, let me deal with what I've got, and so it's part of the satiety signal

292
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:28,230
so it tells you… fat cell, get bigger and it tells your brain, stop feeding your fat cell

293
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,000
so, it's got a dichotomist role, and it's that dichotomist role that is the linchpin

294
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,400
in terms of understanding the physiology of obesity

295
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,230
and I'm gonna get… we're gonna go there. So here's how it works, let's… we have to explain a paradox, here's the paradox

296
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,200
Who has children?

297
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,630
Enough of you. What happens if you give a 5 year old kid a cookie?

298
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,830
Yeah, they eat it, yeah, I know they eat it, what happens after that…

299
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:02,630
they bounce of walls, is what they do, ask any kindergarten teacher what happens when the cupcakes roll out for the birthday party

300
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,030
ok? That's the end of the lesson, ok? They are bouncing off walls, is known as the sugar high

301
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,960
so what's going on, the fat cell gets filled, you know, because of the coookie,

302
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:19,160
the leptin goes up, tells the brain "hey, I've got extra energy on board", it tells the sympathetic nerve system, the fighter/flight part of the nerve system

303
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:29,160
that innervates your muscles, and innervates your fat cells, "hey, I got too much energy", so what happens? you burn it off, so the sympathetic nerve system tone to the muscles give you the fidgeting

304
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,460
and the sympathetic nerve system tone to the fat cells releases the extra fat

305
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,330
and that gets used for energy later, and so this is a nice negative feedback pathway

306
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,760
that keeps you in energy balance as long as your brain can see its leptin

307
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,230
so far so good, so here's the paradox? What happens if you give an obese 5 year old kid a cookie instead?

308
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,400
They are in the pantry looking for more cookies

309
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,700
Anybody ever see a sugar high in an obese kid? Doesn't exist, doesn't exist

310
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,430
and that's why they are obese, it's because they don't get the sugar high, because they can't see their leptin

311
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:11,430
'cause if they could see their leptin they'd have a sugar high. But they don't, that's the point

312
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,960
so something is blocking that leptin signal, that's the paradox, the question is, what is it?

313
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,930
So we learned about leptin from this patient over here, ok?

314
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:27,430
This is the obi obi mouse, the leptin deficient mouse, who has a gene defect in the leptin gene, so this

315
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,360
animal's leptin is zero

316
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,400
so his brain thinks he's starving all the time, so he'll eat anything in sight

317
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,860
not only will he eat anything in sight, but this animal is the ultimate couch potato

318
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:45,160
because his brain can't see his leptin, so he thinks he's starving, so he doesn't want to burn energy, he wants to store it

319
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,530
so, the only reason this animal ever gets off his hind is if you put the food on the other side of the cage, and they'll waddle over to that

320
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:57,260
sit down, eat it there, and stay there instead. Ok, everybody got it? Now,

321
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,360
the reason? Because leptin tells the hypothalamus that you've got the energy to burn

322
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:10,230
so if the hypothalamus sees the leptin signal, then this diamond over here gets activated

323
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,800
anorexigenesis, that is, I'm not hungry, I don't need any more, and I can burn energy effectively

324
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:21,600
and so it tells the sympathetic nerve system turn on to fidget and to release fat from the fat cell

325
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:31,230
and it tells the vagus nerve, the energy storage nerve, "hey, I'm not hungry, appetite down, and stop releasing insulin". Everybody with me?

326
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,860
Conversely if the leptin doesn't reach the hypothalamus, because there is a gene deletion or there is something blocking it

327
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,700
then you get this diamond instead, which is orexigenesis

328
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:50,360
"I'm hungry, I need more food, because I'm starving, and because I'm starving I'm going to try to conserve"

329
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,900
and so that means your sympathetic nerve system tone goes down, which means you sit on a log

330
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:06,430
and your vagus nerve goes up to increase your appetite, so that you'll generate more calories in order to put more into the fat cells to try to get more of a leptin signal, everybody with me?

331
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,930
and this is that same negative feedback pathway I showed you before, now schematized

332
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,300
and there are leptin deficient people, 14 at last count, 14

333
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,230
and they're all of consanguineous marriages and they're all of Pakistani or Turkish ancestry

334
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,060
and when they're born the are perfectly normal weight

335
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,060
and by age six months they are already massively obese

336
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,500
because their brain is constantly starving, it doesn't matter how much weight they gain

337
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,300
their brain can't see it, because it ain't there, because they have a leptin gene defect

338
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:44,160
so here's a patient, 220 pounds by age 9

339
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,230
but you start giving them shots of leptin every day and look what happens, they lose weight on a dime

340
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,830
and it's all fat mass that they are losing too

341
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:59,260
hormone replacement therapy, because now the brain can see leptin because we are giving it to them from a bottle instead of from their own fat cell

342
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,660
hormone replacement therapy, that's what I do as an endocrinologist, that's my job

343
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:08,160
and here's an example, here's the patient at 3 and half years of age, looking pretty awful

344
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,360
and here's after a shot of leptin every day for 4 years, indistinguishable from normal

345
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,760
because we fixed the problem, great right? For those 14 people

346
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,000
The problem is the rest of us are not leptin deficient, the rest of us are leptin resistant

347
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,300
we got boatloads of leptin, and the leptin correlates with how much body fat we have

348
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,230
but if our brain could see that leptin we wouldn't be obese

349
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,760
because we'd burn it off in the sugar high, right? Everybody got it?

350
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,830
So there's something blocking that signaling right there, that X

351
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,160
that's the holy grail of obesity, right there, what is blocking leptin from working

352
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:56,160
'cause if you can't… if your hypothalamus can't see it, then you are in this box over here, and you can see things just go in the wrong direction, and there's your gluttony and there is your sloth

353
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,630
so this is all biochemical

354
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,600
so, what role does insulin play in this leptin debacle? That's the question, remember I told you

355
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,730
insulin tells your fat cell one thing, and your brain the exact opposite

356
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:15,600
it tells your fat cell store, and tells your brain stop. That's the problem

357
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,330
So, this is the patient that got me started in obesity research, now 18 years ago, when I worked at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis

358
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,910
this was a 15 year old boy, who weights 364 pounds in this photo

359
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:35,510
and at age 7 this kid was perfectly normal weight for height, and then he developed this brain tumor sitting in the middle of his energy balance pathway

360
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:41,910
and he required surgery, and he required radiation to kill this astrocytoma, tumor of the brain

361
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,840
and he started gaining weight at the rate of 30 pounds per year non stop

362
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,820
for 8 years until he was 364 pounds and I saw him, ok, everybody with me?

363
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,930
now, this form of intractable obesity due to a brain lesion

364
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,930
now that area of the brain that controls this energy balance is dead

365
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:06,170
so you can have all the leptin in the world but if those neurons are dead, your brain thinks its starving

366
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,220
because it can't transduce that signal

367
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,170
so this is called hypothalamic obesity and this is how I got started in obesity research many many years ago, ok?

368
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,660
So the question is how does this happen, well here are two different hypothesis

369
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:25,510
This hypothesis says well you damage the hypothalamus and you get obesity because it releases a satiety center

370
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:33,200
so now you become hyperphagic, except the data actually doesn't support that, the date doesn't support that there's hyperphagia, that there is too much food intake

371
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,280
actually it supports that there's too little burning, that's what it shows
so now you become hyperphagic, except the data actually doesn't support that, the date doesn't support that there's hyperphagia, that there is too much food intake

372
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,280
actually it supports that there's too little burning, that's what it shows

373
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,600
and that the obesity occurs and then, because of the obesity you have to secret more insulin to tend all that fat

374
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,620
and so that the insulin here is a result of the obesity

375
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,550
but there's this other hypothesis over here that says, the damage to the hypothalamus yes, it leads to obesity,

376
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,640
but because it turns on that vagus nerve, because you can't see your leptin

377
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:02,080
and when you turn on the vagus nerve that tells your pancreas to release more insulin, and that extra insulin drives energy into fat

378
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,460
energy deposition, not energy balance

379
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,750
because of the high insulin, and the insulin is driving the obesity, so which is true?

380
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,280
Well if this is true, nothing I can do about it, 'cause I can't fix a brain

381
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,400
If this is true it gives me a place I can potentially intervene, right between the vagus nerve and the pancreas

382
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,680
and we have a drug that does that, and it's called Octeotride, and it's an endocrine drug that I know how to use

383
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,440
and so we asked the question, if we take these kids who have this intractable obesity due to brain tumors

384
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,350
and we give them this drug to suppress their insulin, might it help? That was the question

385
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:45,910
So here's that same patient I showed you, 364 pounds, and here is a year later 326 first time he took a picture with his shirt off

386
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:51,680
so he did pretty well, ok, I'm gonna show you the ??? over here, this isn't even my patient

387
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,040
this is a beautiful 13 year old girl from Hawaii, notice the flower, ok?

388
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,950
who, like a month after this picture was taken, was in a very severe car accident

389
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,280
on a Honolulu road, and she was in the intensive care unit for a month

390
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,460
and she survived but she struck her hypothalamus, and so this is her a year later

391
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,040
now, does anybody wanna tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?

392
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,640
This kid now can't see her leptin because those neurons are dead

393
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,220
now just so happens I happened to be giving ground rounds at Kaiser Honolulu in 2008

394
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,040
and so they invited the patient and her mother to come to the talk

395
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,710
because they were thinking about putting this kid on octreotide even though she'd never' a brain tumor

396
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,820
because she might have the same disorder, and so there I am with her

397
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,750
and here she is a year and a half later, on the drug, at her high school graduation

398
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,840
Now, who here wants to tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?

399
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,880
Do I have your attention? Ok, it's never gluttony and sloth

400
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:01,550
It's always biochemical, the question is are you smart enough to figure out what the biochemistry is

401
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:08,310
So we said, maybe this could be true in adult obesity without brain tumors or without hypothalamic damage?

402
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,530
So we did a study, actually 2 studies, double blind placebo controlled,

403
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,280
this is a patient, adult, Christmas 1998 holding up food

404
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,620
and here she is 35 pounds later, in her jogging togs, showing me that she wanted to exercise

405
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,460
she actually wanted to exercise, and the reason was because she wasn't storing it

406
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,480
because her insulin went down, because the drug suppressed her insulin

407
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,680
and when her insulin when down, she had the energy to burn

408
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,660
and she wanted to, and she did

409
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:45,730
and she's showing you, right here, that the change in the biochemistry changed her behavior

410
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,280
the biochemistry drives the behavior

411
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,110
so, the cause of leptin resistance, that X up here? It's insulin

412
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:01,330
and there's actually numerous studies now, biochemical, molecular, genetic, that show

413
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,970
that insulin blocks leptin signaling by acting on the same neurons in the brain as leptin does

414
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:12,620
and that's the point, insulin blocks leptin signaling, now why?

415
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,620
What's in it for us, why would God do this to us?

416
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,680
And the answer is because there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, what are they?

417
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,130
Pregnancy is one, and the other is puberty

418
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,260
Puberty and pregnancy, both necessary for survival of the species

419
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,510
If your leptin worked right all the time, you could never gain the weight

420
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,310
because you'd be in the sugar high, you'd be burning it off before you ever had a chance to actually gain weight

421
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,440
you'd be the 97 pound weakling on the beach who couldn't bulk up

422
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,800
and the species would die out

423
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,200
so there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, and both puberty and pregnancy are insulin resistant states

424
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,110
where your insulin goes high very specifically to cause the weight gain

425
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,600
then, you cut the cord, baby's out, sex hormones go back down,

426
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,910
the insulin resistance goes away, you lose the weight and you can start all over again

427
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,200
So it actually makes perfect Darwinian sense that insulin should block leptin

428
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,950
Twice in your life

429
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,730
Twice in your life, insulin should block leptin

430
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,880
Problem is, now it blocks leptin all the time

431
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
'Cause our insulins are high, 24/7/365

432
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,930
so the question is, how come? Where did the increased insulin come from?

433
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,260
That's the question, the 64 zillion dollar question

434
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
why are we all hyperinsulinemic today

435
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,480
If you look at glucose tolerance tests done today vs ones that were done 35 years ago

436
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,460
we're releasing double to triple the amount of insulin today that we were 35 years, and the question is why?

437
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,350
I'm not gonna tell you

438
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm gonna let Will Smith tell you

439
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,040
"What?"

440
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,000
"Guess I owe you some answers, hoss"

441
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,350
"What, you're feeling chatty all of a sudden?"

442
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,080
"Sorry, I can't talk right now. I got some secret cases of my own I'm working on"

443
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,970
"I hate to tear you away from your video game"

444
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,710
"All right, I'm hanging up"

445
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,530
"You know the most destructive force in the universe?"

446
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,200
"Sugar?"

447
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,800
You know, if Hollywood knows this why don't you?

448
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,330
Indeed, he's got it right, ok?

449
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:41,680
So, we know that there are substances out there that are addictive and hazardous to our health

450
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,880
here's a perfect example, and we regulate it

451
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
well, guess what

452
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,130
it's not the only one, this is too

453
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,280
and I'll show you why, so there are the two papers… you know, popular press items

454
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,220
this was from the New York Times magazine in 2011, is sugar toxic, from Gary Taubes based our work here at UCSF

455
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,020
and this is a, Comment, that we had Nature, last year, that got quite a bit of heat

456
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:14,970
more than light unfortunately, called "The toxic truth about sugar" that I wrote with my colleagues here, Laura Schmidt and Claire Brindis at the Institute for Health Policy Studies

457
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,280
So, hazardous to your health, and the reason is because

458
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,330
that common sense notion, a calorie is a calorie

459
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,860
it ain't true, 'cause a calorie is not a calorie

460
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,040
So, what are we talking about? Here we're talking about this stuff called High Fructose Corn Syrup

461
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,880
55% fructose, so they say

462
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,660
there are actually some studies that suggest that dispenser sugar, like from McDonald's, or Burger King, or 7eleven

463
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,840
might actually have 65% fructose sometimes, and that would be a problem

464
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,040
but most of the time it's 55%

465
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,840
one glucose, one fructose

466
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,640
six membered ring, five membered ring

467
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,710
Now this stuff? Is essential for life

468
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,170
Every cell on the planet utilizes glucose for energy

469
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,600
It's so important that if you don't eat it your body makes it, that's how important it is

470
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,710
This guy over here is completely vestigial, there's not one biochemical reaction in the body that requires it

471
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,000
but it's very sweet, and we like it a lot

472
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,660
The question is, what do we do with it if we don't need it for any biochemical reaction?

473
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,060
That's one of the key questions

474
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,240
But over here is sucrose, this is table sugar, cane sugar… the stuff you put in your coffee

475
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,420
one glucose, one fructose

476
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,770
O-glycosidic linkage linking the two

477
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,240
The enzyme in your intestine, sucrase, cleaves this in about a nanosecond

478
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,020
so when you absorb the two moieties they are exactly the same and that's what all the data say

479
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:46,970
is that they are exactly the same, high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are metabolically equal

480
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:52,800
Metabolically bad, metabolically equally bad, ok?

481
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,370
This is what our consumption of fructose, so double it for sugar, has done over the last 100 years

482
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:05,550
so our ancestors, getting foods and vegetables out of the ground with the occasional honey, got about 15 grams of fructose a day

483
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,840
prior to WW2 with the nascent candy and soft drink industries in the country we got to about 20 grams per day

484
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,060
by 1977 we got up to 37 grams per day, this is just before high fructose corn syrup invaded our shores

485
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:23,240
at 8% of total caloric intake, by 1994 we are up to 55 grams a day, that was 10% of total caloric intake

486
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,910
and adolescents currently consume 75 grams per day, that's 12% of caloric intake

487
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,730
and 25% of adolescents consume 100 grams of fructose per day

488
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:38,260
double that for sugar, that's 200 grams of sugar, multiple by 4.1 calories per gram, that's 840 calories in sugar

489
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,150
so for 2000 calorie allotment, that's 40% of calories are sugar, the question is

490
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,040
Can you handle it? Can your liver handle it?

491
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,200
Can you metabolize all that sugar before something bad happens?

492
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,460
Remember what Paracelsus told us: "The dose determines the poison"

493
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,400
Could this be an overdose?

494
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,440
And could that be hazardous to your health? Indeed

495
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,330
So as far as I'm concerned, our entire food supply has been adulterated, fructoselated

496
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,150
because the addition of fructose for palatability, especially with decrease fat

497
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,370
and also sensibly as a browning agent

498
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:18,530
because, food browns better, right? You paint it on your barbecue ribs

499
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,930
to brown it better, right? And the caramelization, actually you know, we like that

500
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,460
and the removal of fiber for shelf life and freezing

501
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,000
we also have substituted trans fats, but those are coming down 'cause we know those are poison

502
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,420
although they are still legal and they are still on the generally recognized as safe list of the FDA

503
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,130
figure that out, 'cause we know they are poison

504
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,150
Now, does sugar cause obesity? Yes, no

505
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,750
Food industry will tell you "Everything causes obesity", and you know what? They are right, it's true

506
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,150
because if you look at this study from Mozzaffarian at New… Harvard School Public Health

507
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,930
looking at what foods cause the most weight gain

508
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,930
potato chips and french fries

509
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,880
indeed, I agree with that

510
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,550
those are the bad guys, in terms of weight gain

511
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,970
Sugar? Distant third

512
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:13,330
And when… a meta analysis was done earlier this year, from the University of Otago,

513
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,080
you'll notice, the diamond doesn't cross the identity line

514
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,930
that means that it's significant

515
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,110
so there is a significant increase in weight, but when you actually look at the… do the math

516
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,480
it's only 0.8 BMI points

517
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,480
remember I told you, we got 7 or 8 BMI points to deal with

518
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,770
so, does sugar cause weight gain?

519
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,060
Yes

520
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Does sugar cause obesity?

521
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,620
A factor. Is sugar THE cause of obesity?

522
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,750
Not even remotely close

523
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:54,970
Ok? And the problem is, it's not about obesity, remember? It's about metabolic syndrome

524
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,530
and that's where the money goes. I don't even care about obesity

525
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,150
what I care about is people getting sick, 'cause I'm a doctor, ok?

526
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:10,880
here's the problem: common wisdom says that sugar is just empty calories and you can get your discretionary calories from anywhere

527
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,970
the problem is that hepatic fructose metabolism is completely different that of glucose

528
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,660
and this is what the first Youtube video went into, in exhausting detail and I will not repeat it

529
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,080
but I'm gonna show you very quickly that chronic fructose exposure alone promotes the metabolic syndrome

530
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,930
so, this again is from that first video

531
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:34,310
when you consume glucose, say rice, white bread, you know starch

532
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:39,330
80% of the glucose goes to all the organs of the body, only 20% hits the liver

533
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,800
and where does it go? It goes to this guy over here, glycogen

534
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,330
Glycogen is liver starch, and liver starch for lack of a better word is good

535
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:54,130
because that's your energy store for a rainy day, that's the first energy that's used when you fast

536
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,880
ok, that's what, why marathoners carb load before a marathon race

537
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,110
is to try to build up their glycogen stores, because glycogen is non toxic

538
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,930
so if you can up your glycogen stores, your liver has more energy in reserve, and that's a good thing

539
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,460
now little of it will sneak down here and get metabolized by the mitochondria

540
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,530
and throw off a little of this stuff called citrate, and that will then get turned into liver fat

541
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:23,680
this process here in orange is called "de novo lipogenesis", new fat making

542
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,220
this is how your liver turns carbohydrates into fat, is through this process here

543
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,820
but you're not dealing with very much carbohydrate here because it all went to glycogen

544
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,880
and most of it actually got metabolized elsewhere anyway

545
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
so your liver is protected

546
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,640
everybody see that? Your liver is protected

547
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,260
so this for a lack of better word is normal, now let's talk about something that's not normal

548
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,510
this guy, alcohol, that's not normal, CH3-CH2-OH

549
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,930
but alcohol is at toxin, right? It's to toxins in one

550
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,570
you wrap your Lamborghini around the tree, right, acute alcohol toxicity

551
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,550
and you fry your liver, chronic alcohol toxicity

552
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,550
we keep it out of the hands of children

553
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,330
here's acute alcohol exposure

554
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,130
here's acute sugar exposure

555
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:13,820
none, why? Because the brain doesn't use fructose for energy, it does use alcohol

556
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,480
but it doesn't use fructose for energy, so you doesn't get any of those CNS symptoms because it doesn't get there

557
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,770
so let's consume the same number of calories as alcohol,

558
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,820
now most of 'em go to the liver, instead of going to the periphery

559
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,200
and what happens to it? You see glycogen anywhere?

560
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,060
No glycogen, it bypasses glycogen and goes down to the mitochondria, and since there's so much of it

561
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:42,310
you get big time fat making, and some of it won't make it out, now you got that lipid droplet, that's alcoholic steatohepatisis

562
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,310
and you're gonna make lot's of triglycerides, and so you are gonna have hypertriglyceridemia

563
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,460
and that's gonna end up in the muscle, now you've got muscle insulin resistance

564
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,020
and it serves as a substrate for weight gain as well

565
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,550
and we also know that alcohol has this dis inhibiting effect on your brain

566
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,550
which causes you to drink more, "oh, I'm just gonna have one drink" and you end up with 5

567
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,170
and of course if you do that too often, maybe you'll live and become and alcoholic

568
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,880
and that's addiction right there, positive feedback effect

569
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,480
so here's a problem, because this is toxic

570
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
and abused, and so we regulate it

571
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,460
now let's do fructose, so we are gonna consume sugar now, we are gonna consume orange juice

572
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:28,040
same number of calories, but glucose does the same 20/80 split it did before, 12 and 48

573
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:35,110
but all the calories from fructose are gonna go to the liver, because only the liver has the transporter for fructose, called glut-5

574
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,510
and, you see glycogen anywhere? No glycogen

575
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,710
Go straight down to the mitochondria, just like alcohol did

576
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:48,310
and because there's so much of it, your mitochondria got no choice but to turn the excess into liver fat

577
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,110
there's your lipid droplet, so now you have non alcoholic steatohepatisis

578
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,130
you've got high triglycerides, just like you did with alcohol

579
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,060
you get the muscle insulin resistance, substrate for obesity

580
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,620
and it tells your insulin receptor not to work

581
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,710
so now you've got liver insulin resistance, which makes your pancreas have to make more insulin

582
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:12,000
in order to make the liver do it's job, now the high insulin goes to the brain, blocks leptin

583
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,860
and now you can't see your leptin, so what does it do? It makes you think you are starving

584
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,910
So what does it make you do? Consume more fructose

585
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:29,110
so now you've got a positive feedback effect between a compound that is toxic and abused

586
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:35,240
causing damage to the liver, damage to the pancreas eventually, and damage to the brain

587
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,860
but we don't do anything about that

588
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:45,600
you'd never think about giving your kid a beer, but you don't think twice about giving your kid a coke and they do the same thing

589
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,370
that's one problem, now there's a second problem

590
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,800
here are 5 photographs, what do they all have in common?

591
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,440
There's one thing they have all…, they're all

592
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,110
Brown! Good, thank you, they are all brown. This is the browning reaction

593
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:08,660
The Maillard reaction, anybody you know what HbA1c is?

594
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,510
That's the lab test they do for diabetics to see how they blood sugar control is

595
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,530
that's glucose binding to proteins in the blood

596
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,680
well, that's what this is, this is the Maillard reaction

597
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,710
glucose binding to proteins in the actual food

598
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,040
so the common link is this browning, or Maillard reaction, or non enzymatic glycation

599
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,170
so here's the deal, you can think of it this way

600
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,800
you can roast your meat at 375 degrees for an hour

601
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,660
or you can roast your meat at 98.6 degrees for 75 years

602
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,640
the answer is the same, ok? We all brown

603
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,200
it's part of aging, it's normal aging, and everyone does it, the question is how fast do you do it?

604
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,750
And if you don't believe me, here's just an example, here's newborn rib cartilage nice and white

605
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,660
and here's 88 year old rib cartilage nice and brown

606
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,820
and if you had orange juice this morning you are browning faster

607
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:06,000
that's the deal, and we know it, we know it's true

608
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,080
because every time this reaction occurs you release a hydrogen peroxide

609
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,000
and that hydrogen peroxide does damage inside the cell, unless it's quenched by an antioxidant

610
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,130
and if you don't take enough antioxidants, you're gonna do damage, and that's what non alcoholic steatohepatisis is

611
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,550
so here's that reaction, here's the aldehyde of glucose

612
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,770
and it binds to the amino group of lysine of the hemoglobin molecule

613
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:38,440
forms what is known as a shift base, which then… decomposes and develops this mid linkage here

614
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,910
and bottom line is, it's non enzymatic and happens all the time, the question is how much?

615
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:50,970
and this shows that it's very very specific to fructose in terms of a mapped ?

616
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:58,480
so this is a animal model of non alcoholic fatty liver disease, called the methionine choline deficient rat

617
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,910
the MCD rat, not the McDonald's rat, but it might as well be

618
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:09,370
because what happens is, when you give the animal sugar or starch with normal amounts of methionine choline

619
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,600
no problem, the liver can handle it

620
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,000
but if you're deficient, which happens when you have a bad diet

621
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,680
then only sugar causes the problem

622
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:27,420
starch doesn't, and you can see here in a non alcoholic fatty liver disease clinic

623
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,800
at Duke University, this is Dr. Manal Abdelmalek's work

624
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,660
showing that the grade of steatosis or fatty liver is dependent on

625
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,820
the… how much fructose consumption, whether it's daily or not

626
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,570
and the stage of fibrosis same thing

627
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,000
Ok, so two problems:

628
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,330
fatty liver and cell aging

629
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:51,820
so far, so good? All right, so now we are gonna get into the weeds

630
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,420
so here are the 10 most obese states in the nation

631
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,260
Anybody surprised? Anybody from any of them?

632
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,170
I used to live in Memphis, you know what I'm talking about, right?

633
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:07,680
North Carolina, you know what I'm talking about, right, …it's those ribs, yeah, I know [laughter]

634
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,950
10 most obese states, here are the 10 laziest states in the nation

635
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,750
What's going on over there in Nevada?

636
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:21,510
I guess you can only burn so much energy going like this

637
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:26,000
Here are the 10 most unhappy states in the nation

638
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,240
Here's the adult diabetes rate

639
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,910
Here's the adult heart disease rate

640
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:39,730
And finally here is soda per capita soda consumption, now what you see?

641
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,640
Pretty significant overlap, wouldn't you say? Ya?

642
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,930
Well now this is correlation, not causation

643
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,400
and I'm very clear on the difference, we are gonna talk about the difference, ok?

644
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,200
So the question is which direction does it go?

645
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,750
Is it that soda causes heart disease and diabetes

646
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,400
or is it that people with heart disease and diabetes like to drink soda?

647
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,350
You can't tell

648
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:07,150
'cause it's one snapshot in time, you can't tell which way the data went

649
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,620
True

650
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,020
Here's what happening world wide

651
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,710
So this is global consumption of sugar and sugar crops

652
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,150
here we are at 629 calories availability here in blue

653
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:27,680
and here's the rest of the world. Now the American Heart Association says 150 to 200 calories in added sugar per day, right? Here this color, blue

654
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,370
How many countries are above that? How about all of them?

655
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:36,220
In fact that's why diabetes is skyrocketing everywhere

656
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,460
So here's world sugar consumption tripling over the past 50 years

657
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,730
Per capita consumption, notice Brazil

658
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,260
Brazil used to be a poor country

659
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,620
they were always a sugar exporter

660
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,710
but they couldn't afford their own sugar

661
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,600
but now they can because they are a BRIC country, right? They sell

662
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,570
? jets, and biodiesel, and you know like… world cup… you know, all that stuff

663
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:05,730
and the fact is that Brazil now has the highest increase in rate of prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world

664
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:13,680
doesn't have the highest prevalence, that's reserved for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Malasia

665
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,420
Why them? Why do they have the highest diabetes rates in the world?

666
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,620
No alcohol, no alcohol

667
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,440
But they got soft drinks like they are going out of style, why? 'Cause it's hot,

668
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,420
and the watter supply is a question mark,

669
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:34,220
and NO ALCOHOL! This is their reward

670
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,770
Now the difference is, alcohol, for lack of a better word, is self limiting

671
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:44,310
because you end up under the table

672
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:50,620
but soft drinks? You can drink them all day, right? And they do

673
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,880
And that's why they have diabetes, now

674
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,770
how do I know that the sugar ¡cause the diabetes?

675
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,150
Because correlation is not causation but we have causation too

676
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,020
and this is our work, just came out 3 months ago, very proud of it

677
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,750
Sanjay Basu, one of my colleagues at Standford Prevention Institute,

678
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,440
took 4 databases and melded them together

679
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,220
we took the Food and Agriculture Organization or FAO statistics database

680
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,600
from the World Health Organization

681
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,570
which for the whole decade, 2000 to 2010

682
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,240
which has food supply as total calories

683
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:28,170
foods excluding wine, oils, roots, tubers, pulses, nuts and vegetables, meat, cereals, and sugar, sugar crops and sweeteners

684
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,080
as separate items

685
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,750
we then linked that to the International Diabetes Federation statistics database

686
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,910
for diabetes prevalence worldwide, for the decade

687
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,680
and then we linked that to the World Bank Gross National Income database to control for

688
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,620
GDP, urbanization and aging

689
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,260
and then we linked that to a physical activity database, to control for physical inactivity

690
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,820
and we asked the question: what about the world's diet

691
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,600
predicts diabetes prevalence change over time worldwide?

692
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,710
That was our question, everybody with me? Ok

693
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:04,930
So here's what we did, 204 countries, we had complete data for 154,

694
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:11,550
the 50 that we did not use were no different from the 154 by a very fancy set of statistics

695
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,770
we did a lot of statistics, this is called an econometric analysis

696
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:21,730
now a standard, percent vs percent, would be called an ecological analysis

697
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:25,730
this is not an ecological analysis, this is an econometrical analysis

698
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:31,680
this actually won 2 economists Nobel Prizes for being able to predict stock market crashes

699
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,750
ok, based on what's happening before, to predict what happens after

700
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,570
ok? Cause there is causation inference in this

701
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:44,840
Generalized estimating equations with a conservative fixed effects approach, called the Hausman test,

702
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,820
a hazard model to control for selection bias called the Heckman test,

703
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,370
this is the important one, since we had the whole decade

704
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,800
we didn't have a snapshot, we had the movie

705
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,330
and you can learn a whole lot more from a movie, than you can from a snapshot, can't you

706
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:04,930
that's called the Granger causality test, because we can determine what came first

707
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,600
'cause you can't infer causation if something didn't come first, right?

708
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,750
Proximate cause, you need proximate cause

709
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:20,040
and period effects to control for secular trends, so we did all of this really really neat statistical analysis and Sanjay Basu is an absolute genius

710
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:26,620
and what we did was a control for GDP, obesity, urbanization aging and physical activity

711
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:33,640
so the question was, is it the obesity or is it something specific in the food supply? That was the question

712
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:41,460
So, during the decade diabetes prevalence rose from 5.5 to 7 percent world wide, not good

713
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:48,970
and here's the effects model: sugar, sugar plus controls plus period, bottom line, remember that diamond that can't cross the identity line?

714
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,860
well, it doesn't, it's very significant

715
00:57:51,860 --> 00:58:00,440
in fact, for every 100 calories you increase your diabetes prevalence worldwide by 0.8%

716
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,000
and here's the adjusted associated when you took all the factors into account between sugar availability

717
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,640
and diabetes prevalence

718
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,150
here's what you need to take home, this is the take home slide

719
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:18,970
only changes in sugar availability predicted those changes in diabetes prevalence worldwide, only

720
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,930
if you consumed a 150 calories extra per day,

721
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:30,040
in total calories, diabetes prevalence only went up by 0.1%, pffft, nothing

722
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,240
but if those 150 calories happen to be a can of soda

723
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,440
diabetes prevalence went up eleven fold

724
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:43,150
1.1%, and we are not consuming one can of soda per day, we are consuming two and a half

725
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,970
so that's 2.4%

726
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,040
given that American diabetes rates are 8.3%

727
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:54,750
that means that 26% of all diabetes in America today is due to sugar and sugar alone

728
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,800
not due to obesity, not due to total calories, sugar and sugar alone

729
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:05,150
You wanna do something? You want something actionable? You want something that's gonna change how much money we spend

730
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,770
so we can salvage Medicare? Here it is,

731
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:15,550
and of course our government is doing absolutely nothing, ok?

732
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:21,680
Our data show that 25% of diabetes worldwide is explained by sugar

733
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,550
and more importantly, this is causation

734
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:31,150
because these data meet what's known as the Bradford Hill, the Austin Bradford Hill criteria

735
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,530
for what we call causal medical inference

736
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:39,200
now, what does that mean, it means that

737
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,730
you can show dose effect

738
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:46,260
you can show duration effect, of sugar on diabetes,

739
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,330
and you can show most importantly directionality

740
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,420
that is, those countries where sugar went up showed an increase in diabetes rates

741
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,000
those countries, the few of them, where sugar went down showed decreased diabetes rates

742
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,930
and precedence, 3 year time differential

743
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,640
so every country when their sugar went up

744
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,550
3 years later you saw the change in diabetes, in either direction

745
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:13,680
that's causal medical inference, now

746
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,150
it's not scientific proof, so there are different kinds of proofs

747
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,910
there is anecdotal data, which of course is absolute garbage and you can't do anything with that

748
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,440
because an N of 1 means nothing

749
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,880
then there's correlation, but correlation suffers from this directionality question

750
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,530
which came first, 'cause it's a snapshot and you can't tell,

751
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:37,420
then there's this thing called causal medical inference, we're gonna talk about that right now

752
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,910
and then there's this thing called scientific proof that everybody keeps harping on

753
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:48,350
so, in medicine today, what percentage of what we know

754
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:55,510
is scientifically based, evidence based, scientific proof, randomized control trials?

755
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:02,660
That's the standard. How much of what we know, what percent of what we know today, is due to scientific proof, what do you think?

756
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:10,260
Wanna give me a percentage? 10, 10? 10% of what we know is due to randomized controlled trials

757
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,350
that means 90% of what we know is causal medical inference

758
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:18,800
so here's the question, what level of proof do you need?

759
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,200
You tell me. Who here believes in global warming?

760
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,260
Why? Got any proof?

761
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,600
Causal inference

762
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,240
Can you randomize a controlled trial and show me that that's what's going on? No

763
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:42,750
Who here believes that football trauma causes Alzheimers?

764
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:48,530
How come? You got proof?

765
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:55,280
Causal inference. Who here believes that tobacco causes lung cancer?

766
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,310
How come? You got proof?

767
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:04,130
Who's done the randomized controlled trial where you take naive people

768
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:08,530
and expose them to cigarette smoke for the next 50 years and see what their lung cancer rates are?

769
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:12,660
Number 1, it would be too expensive, number 2, it would be damn unethical, wouldn't it?

770
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,020
In fact most of these studies would be damn unethical

771
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,280
You ever think we are gonna get the actual scientific studies, the scientific proof

772
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,310
for sugar causing diabetes? Number 1, nobody's got a zero baseline,

773
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:29,640
nobody's naive, number 2, this is something that happens over 40, 50, 60 years

774
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:35,150
how are you going to keep people on the same diet for that long

775
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:40,710
and how are you gonna figure out what they actually ate when we can't even figure it out after one day

776
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:45,280
Ok? And don't you think that would be a little unethical? To do that to people?

777
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,550
You'll never get these data, but of course, the food industry says:

778
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,350
"Well, we don't have the data, we need more research"

779
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:55,550
We always need more research, of course we need more research,

780
01:02:55,550 --> 01:03:00,220
the question is, do we have enough proof to act?

781
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,130
Them saying "we need more proof" is them moving the goalposts

782
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,460
because we'll never get enough proof for them

783
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:10,350
the question is, what do you think? Do you think we have enough?

784
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,930
We have causal medical inference for sugar and diabetes, do we have enough?

785
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:18,400
It's for you to decide, ok?

786
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,880
Ok, addictive, the last piece of this

787
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:31,550
Bingeing on high-calorie foods may be as addictive as cocaine or nicotine, and could cause compulsive eating and obesity according to a study, ok

788
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,950
So here are all these books that came out on obesity, and addiction, and reward,

789
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,840
you know, they are all popular books, ok?

790
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,530
based on no data, but what do you think? You think that science could catch up to this?

791
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:49,020
So here's neuroimaging studies, PET scanning,

792
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:54,930
of dopamine receptors, dopamine is the feel-good neurotransmitter, the pleasure neurotransmitter in the reward center here

793
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:59,680
so here's a control brain with nice hot dopamine receptors, which is good

794
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,570
and here's a cocaine brain where they've been damped down

795
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,550
This is the neuroanatomic equivalent of the phenomenon of tolerance

796
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:11,280
Ok? Because dopamine down regulates its own receptor, so

797
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:17,060
once this happens you need more substrate to get the same effect, that's called tolerance

798
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,510
Ok? And then of course when you withdraw it, now you get withdrawal and you get symptoms, everybody with me?

799
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:25,330
Well here's a control brain, and here's an obese brain, what do you see?

800
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:29,550
Same thing, not quite as bad, but same concept

801
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:35,510
So here's the reward system, here's the ventral tegmental area here, where the dopamine neurons live

802
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,220
and here's the nucleus Accumbens, where the dopamine information gets received

803
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,600
and so how fast this gets transduced

804
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,930
has everything to do with what level of reward you achieve

805
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:51,860
with any given stimulus, whether be power or gambling, or shopping or

806
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:56,710
cocaine or alcohol, or for that matter, sugar

807
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:00,400
and this just shows what happens, so here's that dopamine neuron

808
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,820
and you see it's going blip, blip, blip, right?

809
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:10,040
So you add nicotine, blip blip blip blip blip blip, you get more reward, that's basically what we are talking about, that's why people start smoking

810
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:15,420
and then of course the dopamine receptors go down and they can't stop smoking, that's addiction

811
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:20,570
If an food readout… a food intake is a readout of reward

812
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,820
'cause here's injecting morphine into the reward center

813
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,150
and you can see that as the morphine goes up the food intake goes up

814
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,880
because food intake is a readout of reward

815
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,770
and you can see that all the reward centers are all linked together

816
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:42,570
into the nucleus accumbens, including the hypothalamus, which is the starvation area,

817
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,880
the amygdala, which is the fear area,

818
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,020
and of course the reward area, so hunger, reward and stress

819
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,020
all reasons to eat

820
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:55,460
and they all conspire against us all at the same time

821
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,730
so when we see a patient in our clinic

822
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:02,620
that's the question we ask ourselves, is this patient obese because they are hungry?

823
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,880
and I know what to do about that

824
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,660
or is this patient obese because of the reward system, it's defective?

825
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:15,510
and they are addicted? That's a lot harder to deal with, but we know how to do that too

826
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:19,680
Or is this person eating because of stress?

827
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,240
Which is enormous problem, especially in America

828
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:28,440
And that one is really a hard one, because it's not the stress, it's the response to stress

829
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,480
So if you think you are stressed, you are stressed, whether you are or not

830
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,770
and most kids today are stressed like never before

831
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,060
and you know what stresses them the most?

832
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,530
Facebook

833
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:49,510
And this is going on in every animal, see us humans right there, big dopamines there

834
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:53,860
receptors here, when obese, dopamine receptors go down

835
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,730
here are Bonnet macaques, same thing, and here are rats, same thing

836
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,370
bottom line, obesity means downregulation of dopamine receptors, which means

837
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:06,170
you need more food to get the same level of reward, or you might as well crawl in a hole and die

838
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,600
ok, that's what it's all about

839
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,310
So these people are eating because their brain says they have to

840
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:17,510
So, the question is, is fast food addictive? What do you think?

841
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:23,420
Yes? No? Ok, so we actually looked at that question

842
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,420
So everybody familiar with this book?

843
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,440
Michael Moss put this out, "Salt, sugar, fat, how the giants hooked us", right?

844
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,060
This is wrong, this is a mistake

845
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,770
'Cause there is one thing not on the list

846
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:35,820
What's missing?
'Cause there is one thing not on the list

847
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,530
What's missing?

848
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,130
Caffeine

849
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:45,280
Now we've got fast food! Ok, salt, sugar, fat and caffeine, right?

850
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,480
So the question is, of these four which are addictive?

851
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,460
Let's talk about salt. Is salt addictive?

852
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,330
No, it's not addictive

853
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,620
In humans the threshold is physiologically fixed

854
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,110
higher levels are attributable to preference

855
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,400
but you can alter that preference, lot's of people do

856
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,530
specially when they have to go low salt for some reason

857
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:10,080
and we know because we take care of a disease in endocrinology called "salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia"

858
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,510
were their kidneys are losing salt non stop

859
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,280
but when we give them the salt retaining hormone that works in the kidney called aldosterone

860
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,860
their salt intake goes way down

861
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:22,080
and if they were addicted that wouldn't happen

862
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,060
so when we fix their physiology their

863
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:31,420
preference gets a lot better. So salt? Not addictive.

864
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,970
Now let's take fat. Is fat addictive? What do you think?

865
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:39,370
Nope, rodents binge but show no signs of dependence, and humans

866
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:43,680
they always bing on high fat high carb or high sugar

867
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,880
items, like pizza and icecream, you don't binge on high fat per se, otherwise the Atkins diet would have everybody addicted and they'll tell you

868
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,200
you know they are losing weight, how could they lose weight if they are all addicted?

869
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,950
Energy density actually has a stronger association with obesity and metabolic syndrome than fat does

870
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:04,440
so, fat? Not addictive

871
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,350
So we are left with these two

872
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,280
Caffeine? Oh man, caffeine is addictive

873
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,950
and if you take my Starbucks away from me I'll kill you

874
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:17,110
model drug of dependence, gateway drug in fact

875
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:23,600
dependence show in children, adolescence, adults, 30% who consume it meet the DSM criteria for dependence

876
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,930
and physiological addiction is well established with the headache, and the test performance, and everything else

877
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,840
Mega addictive, ok?

878
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:35,110
But d'you see anybody going out and regulating Starbucks or Pits or anything like that?

879
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:37,770
Why? Because it's not toxic

880
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:42,660
It's addictive, but not toxic, unless you mix it with alcohol and then you got something called four loco

881
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,200
and that we are banning, everybody got it?

882
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,060
So when it's toxic and addictive we ban it or we regulate it

883
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,130
And so, caffeine and alcohol together that's a bad deal

884
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:56,840
but caffeine alone? Keep your hands of my Starbucks, ok

885
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,730
So caffeine? Yes, addictive

886
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:04,080
Ok, that leaves this one. Sugar, is sugar addictive? What do you think?

887
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,280
You know, we've known this for a long time, because, anybody know what this is?

888
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,550
It's called "sweeties", "sweeties"

889
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:19,420
This is a super concentrated sucrose, sugar solution, that you dip the pacifier in

890
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:24,310
and you put in the newborn baby boy's mount before you do the the circumcision

891
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,910
because it releases opioids and deadens the pain

892
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:30,570
and this has been known forever

893
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:35,460
Ok? Then you mix it with a little wine and then you got a really good cocktail, eh?

894
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:41,510
So is there really such a thing as sugar addiction, we have to look for similarities to other drugs of dependence like nicotine, morphine, amphetamine, cocaine,

895
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,600
the one I think is most appropriate is alcohol

896
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,150
because after all alcohol and sugar are basically metabolized the same way, because after all where do you get alcohol from?

897
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,370
Fermentation of sugar, it's called wine

898
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,860
right? We do it every day, up in Sonoma

899
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,260
the big difference between alcohol and sugar is that

900
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,660
for alcohol the yeast does the first step of metabolism called glycolysis

901
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,110
for sugar we do our own first step, but after that

902
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,080
when the mitochondria see it it doesn't matter where it came from

903
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,950
and that's the point, and that's why they both cause the same diseases

904
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,400
and they do the same thing to the brain

905
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,440
so for the criteria for addiction in animals are bingeing,

906
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,550
withdrawal, craving,

907
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:24,260
and then there is one down here called cross-sensitization with other drugs of abuse, that means

908
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,660
that if you expose an animal to one drug of abuse, like cocaine

909
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,570
for 3 weeks and addict them

910
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:35,150
and then you expose them to a second drug they've never seen before, like say amphetamine

911
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:38,130
they're addicted to the amphetamine even though they'd never seen it before

912
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:43,510
because the dopamine receptors are already downregulated 'cause they are the same dopamine receptors, everybody got it?

913
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:46,750
Ok? And so, does sugar do this? Absolutely

914
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:50,080
Q.E.D. slammed on, sugar is addictive in animals

915
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,130
What about humans? Who saw this movie?

916
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:57,330
Right? Did you like it?

917
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,930
More or less?

918
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:03,370
I've a big problem with this movie, because if you watch the movie

919
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:06,350
his doctor, Morgan's doctor keeps saying:

920
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:11,640
"You gotta get off this high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet"

921
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,750
Not the high fat diet, it's the high sugar diet,

922
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,730
high sugar diet, that's what caused all the problems

923
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,510
So, can sugar be addictive?

924
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,620
Watch. "I was feeling bad"

925
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,080
"In the car, feeling like…", sorry, "…really"

926
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,910
"I was feeling really, really"

927
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,080
"sick and unhappy"

928
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,040
"started eating, feel great"

929
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,550
"feel really good now"

930
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,730
"I feel so good as crazy"

931
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,640
"Ain't that right baby? Yeah you're right darling"

932
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,260
This was on day 18, ok?

933
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,020
of his 30 day ? through McDonald's

934
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,480
He just described withdrawal, that's withdrawal

935
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,260
and he needed another hit in order to feel good again

936
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,350
he just described withdrawal, he was a vegan, right? 'cause his girlfriend was a vegan chef

937
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:05,680
and in 18 days he's a sugar addict

938
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,280
so, you tell me. So this is what we are dealing with

939
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,110
We are dealing with an industry that

940
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:21,060
wants us to consume its product, well gee, every industry wants us to consume their product in some fashion or another, the question is

941
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,570
what if it hurts you? What if it hurts you?

942
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:29,020
So… this is an example, this is the Federal Trade Commision vs Sugar Information

943
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,710
back in 1972, this was an arm of the Sugar Research Association

944
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:40,710
"The fat time of day you are really hungry and ready to eat two of everything, here's how sugar can help"

945
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,280
Any data?

946
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,770
They are allowed to do… they can advertise any way they want, they are allowed

947
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,570
How about this one, the birth of the un-cola

948
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:54,880
"Why we have the youngest customers in the business" from 7up

949
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,170
You ok with that? And this is, you know this is going on

950
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:03,770
How about this one, this was in Publix supermarket chain in Florida just a year ago

951
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,530
"Drinks are on us! Publix is rewarding top grades with free apple juice and soda. Students"

952
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,110
"we salute your thirst for knowledge"

953
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,530
Well, the American Heart Association gets it

954
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,310
and I'm a proud member of the American Heart Association

955
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:24,620
because they get it, the high fat hypothesis has been debunked

956
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:30,080
and they have taken it back, 2010 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Krauss et al, ok?

957
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,260
But this is dietary sugar intake in cardiovascular health

958
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,600
I was a coauthor of this, and very proud to have been so

959
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,170
and we recommend a reduction in sugar consumption from 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day

960
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,420
down to either 9 for males or 6 for females

961
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:48,620
that's a reduction by two thirds to three quarters

962
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:52,530
How we gonna do that? How we gonna ever accomplish that?

963
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:58,170
Especially since we don't even know we are consuming it

964
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:05,280
Because only 1/3 of our total added sugar intake comes from sugar sweetened beverages, like soda, juice, sport drinks

965
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,820
1/6 comes from things we that call desserts, you know, candy, icecream, things like that

966
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,680
that means one half of our sugar consumption is hidden

967
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:19,150
in foods that we didn't even know had sugar, like salad dressing, yogurt is a big one

968
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:22,750
Anybody here yogurt is healthy?

969
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,680
I got a bridge to sell you

970
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:33,330
Plain yogurt? Sure! You wanna take some whole fruit and mix it with plain yogurt like they do in Europe?

971
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:37,550
No problem! Off you go, ok? But

972
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:42,660
processed yogurt? You know, the stuff they are selling on the shelves of the supermarket?

973
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,530
Take a look, just take a look at the amount of sugar

974
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,910
Now it's total sugar, so some of it is lactose, which is milk sugar

975
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:54,800
the question is, how much of it is lactose and how much of it is added sugar

976
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,800
You can't know. You are not allowed to know.

977
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,950
'Cause the food industry won't let you know

978
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:06,660
Because in 1989 the food industry lobbied the Food and Drug Administration

979
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:11,020
when they were coming out with the nutrition labeling and education act of 1990, and they said:

980
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:14,930
"If we told our consumers, our customers"

981
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:19,460
"how much added sugar we put in each of our processed foods"

982
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:22,480
"our competitors could duplicate our recipes"

983
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,240
"this is proprietary information and you are not allowed to know it"

984
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,130
and you know what the FDA said?

985
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,930
"Eh… ok, sure". That just shows

986
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:40,400
Here's what you need to know, of the 600000 items in the American grocery store today

987
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,680
80% of them are spiked with added sugar

988
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,710
and that's not for our purposes, that's for the industry's, 'cause they know when they add it

989
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:51,550
you buy more

990
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,350
for all the reasons that we've just discussed

991
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:57,860
and worse yet, there are 56 names for sugar

992
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:02,220
and you don't know them, and you are not allowed to know them

993
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:06,080
so, does anybody what florida crystals are?

994
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,350
Sugar, anybody know what evaporated cane juices

995
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:13,950
If you evaporate cane juices what do you get? You get sugar, ok?

996
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:16,080
And so that's what they use in yogurt, because

997
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,150
"Oh, cane juice must be healthy, right? Oh, came… juice from cane, right?"

998
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:27,240
So here's how your food dollars have been bastardized and reallocated for you

999
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,110
Meats, this is 1982, 30 years ago, here's 2012

1000
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:35,240
Meats down 10%, because of that little fat directive

1001
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,770
Fruits and vegetables? The same

1002
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:41,950
so everybody says eat your fruits and vegetables, you know what? We are eating just as much as we were before

1003
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:48,170
Grains and baked goods, 13 to 14%, everybody says it's all the carbohydrate, it's all up a little bit

1004
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:54,880
Dairy products, 13 down to 10%, because now everyone is lactose intolerant

1005
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,440
Processed foods and sweets, 11.6 - 22.9

1006
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,770
a doubling in 30 years, that's what's happened

1007
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:09,280
that's the change, and that's what we are talking about tonight

1008
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,640
because processed foods is high sugar, low fiber

1009
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,640
and real food is low sugar, high fiber

1010
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:25,820
and every diet that works is low sugar, high fiber, because every diet that works is real food

1011
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,170
that's what this is about, this is a processed foods disaster

1012
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,930
but the food industry is making money of it

1013
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,840
in fact, lots of it

1014
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,880
because here is the S&P 500 over the last 5 years

1015
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,860
Ok? Here's the economic downturn of 2008 right here

1016
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:45,820
and here's the stock price of Mc Donald's, Coke and Pepsi, they are doing very well, thank you

1017
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:51,730
and here's General Mills, Hormel, ConAgra, Kraft, Proctor & Gamble, Archer Daniels Midland, and

1018
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:55,770
I said Hormel I think already, bottom line, they are all doing better than the S&P

1019
01:18:55,770 --> 01:19:00,220
Wanna make money? Invest in a food company, 'cause they have a winning formula

1020
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,600
for getting you to eat more

1021
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,840
so, back to that first law, remember?

1022
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,730
It's not about common sense, it's about the science

1023
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:13,460
so let's restate it, let's reframe the argument

1024
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:19,330
If you are gonna store it, that is an obligate weight gain due to energy deposition

1025
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:24,000
the most obvious of which is high insulin, and you know where that came from,

1026
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,440
and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life

1027
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,460
because energy expenditure and quality of life are synonymous

1028
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:35,820
things that make your energy expenditure go up make you feel good, like a ? off the market

1029
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,570
caffeine, for two hours, exercise,

1030
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,840
things that make your energy expenditure go down make you feel lousy

1031
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,440
hypothyroidism, starvation

1032
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:51,550
so, if you gonna store it, energy deposition, and you expect to burn it

1033
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,400
then you have to eat it, same first law

1034
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,710
but now reinterpreted based on the science, not the common sense

1035
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:04,800
because the aberrant behaviors are the result our biochemistry

1036
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,600
and our biochemistry is a result of our changed environment

1037
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:15,280
and the only way we are gonna fix it, is to change the environment back

1038
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,860
so, here's a list of diseases

1039
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,280
everyone of these was a personal responsibility disease

1040
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,600
until the sheer weight magnitude and gravity, and the money that went into it

1041
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,800
made it very clear that it was a public health crisis instead

1042
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,860
and here are some more newer ones

1043
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:40,970
and these are very clearly personal responsibility diseases, right?

1044
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:45,510
except they are not, they are public health crises, how about this one down here?

1045
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:51,110
What do you think about guns? San Francisco so I know what you think about guns, but

1046
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:56,400
John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister

1047
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:04,480
perhaps the most conservative politician in the last 100 years in any country

1048
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,330
banned assault weapons in Australia, back in the late 90s

1049
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:13,460
and he was on CNN about two months ago, and they asked him: "I mean, how could you do that?"

1050
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:20,170
"A conservative… you know, politician, how could… libertarian, how could you ban guns", and he said:

1051
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:24,130
"Look, this is not a democratic issue, this is not an republican issue"

1052
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:29,640
"This is not a liberal issue, this is not a conservative issue, this is a public safety issue"

1053
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,530
That's exactly right, even he got it,

1054
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,660
even he got it, but we don't get it,

1055
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,680
well this is a public safety issue, because we will have no Medicare

1056
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,460
So the questions I'm gonna leave you with, I've two homework assignments for you

1057
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:48,530
Can our toxic food environment be changed without governmental or societal intervention?

1058
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:51,820
Especially when there are potentially addictive substances involved

1059
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:56,350
Has education worked for any substance of abuse?

1060
01:21:56,350 --> 01:22:01,600
Not one, did Nancy Reagan just said "No work"?

1061
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:08,000
Does the Surgeon General's warning on a pack of cigarettes stop people from smoking

1062
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,370
No, the thing that stop people from smoking was second hand smoke

1063
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:16,930
when your smoking affected me

1064
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:19,420
that's when we started getting legislation

1065
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,910
and then the tobacco documents came out and we realized there was corporate malfeasance involved

1066
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:26,220
that's when things changed

1067
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,820
but not one lick of education made any difference

1068
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,730
in the amount of tobacco consumed, and Stan Glance ? right here at UCSF showed that very nicely

1069
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:39,680
Second question: can we afford to wait?

1070
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,150
The food industry will say "we need more research"

1071
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,280
"We need more research", of course they're gonna say we need more research, it's moving the goalposts

1072
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:56,800
Can we afford to wait, to enact these public health measures, when health-care will be bankrupt due to chronic metabolic disease in just 13 short years?

1073
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,860
That's your homework assignment

1074
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:03,280
So, this is my second to last slide

1075
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:09,820
This is a paper that just came out in Lancet, in March

1076
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:17,200
"Profits and pandemics: prevention of harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink food industries"

1077
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,370
And what it says is, that what we used to practice was called the old medicine

1078
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:27,510
and we focused on infections as the problem and microbes as the vectors

1079
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:31,060
and now the new medicine is all about chronic disease

1080
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:36,710
and the vector has changed, it is now multinational corporations instead

1081
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,400
that's who we're battling

1082
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,460
so for further reading I refer you to a whole bunch of academical articles

1083
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:53,060
and more academical articles,

1084
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:58,080
and finally, non academic, if you choose to pick it up

1085
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,020
"Fat chance" which was written for the public, but really to be honest with you, I wrote it for doctors

1086
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:07,280
my publisher says "You cannot write a book for doctors, we won't publish it", I said "Ok, fine"

1087
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,880
"I'll write it for the public"

1088
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,840
but I really wrote it for doctors because the whole medical profession has to change

1089
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:18,130
and the problem is they bought the bill of goods that the industry was selling

1090
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:23,550
and we gotta fix it, because a calorie is not a calorie, it never was and never will be

1091
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:23,680
so, lastly we have started a non profit
and we gotta fix it, because a calorie is not a calorie, it never was and never will be

1092
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,950
so, lastly we have started a non profit

1093
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:32,880
very specifically to provide medical nutrition and legal analysis

1094
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,440
and consultation to promote personal and public health against Big Food

1095
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,910
called the Institute for Responsible Nutrition, there is our website

1096
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,350
and contact me if you'd like any more information

1097
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:51,240
So I wanna thank my collaborators, here at UCSF, the Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health Clinic

1098
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:59,550

1100
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:11,150
Touro University, my colleague Jean-Marc Schwarz who is a card carrying fructose biochemist and vetted all the biochemistry on this

1101
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:16,620
Kathleen Mulligan at the UCSF Clinical Translational Sciences Institute, who is my right hand

1102
